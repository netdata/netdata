# Reinstall the Netdata Agent

In certain situations, such as needing to enable a feature or troubleshoot an issue, you may need to reinstall the
Netdata Agent on your node.

Before you try reinstalling Netdata, figure out which [installation method you
used](/packaging/installer/UPDATE.md#determine-which-installation-method-you-used) if you do not already know. This will
determine the reinstallation method.

## One-line installer script (`kickstart.sh`)

Run the one-line installer script with the `--reinstall` parameter to reinstall the Netdata Agent. This will preserve
any [user configuration](/docs/configure/nodes.md) in `netdata.conf` or other files.

If you used any [optional
parameters](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md#optional-parameters-to-alter-your-installation) during initial
installation, you need to pass them to the script again during reinstallation. If you cannot remember which options you
used, read the contents of the `.environment` file and look for a `REINSTALL_OPTIONS` line. This line contains a list of
optional parameters.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --reinstall
```

## `.deb` or `.rpm` packages

If you installed Netdata with [`.deb` or `.rpm` packages](/packaging/installer/methods/packages.md), use your
distribution's package manager to reinstall Netdata. Any custom settings present in your Netdata configuration directory
(typically at `/etc/netdata`) persists during this process.

```bash
apt-get install --reinstall netdata   # Ubuntu/Debian
dnf reinstall netdata                 # Fedora/RHEL
yum reinstall netdata                 # CentOS
zypper in -f netdata                  # openSUSE
```

## Pre-built static binary for 64-bit systems (`kickstart-static64.sh`)

Run the one-line installer script with the `--reinstall` parameter to reinstall the Netdata Agent. This will preserve
any [user configuration](/docs/configure/nodes.md) in `netdata.conf` or other files.

If you used any [optional
parameters](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart-64.md#optional-parameters-to-alter-your-installation) during
initial installation, you need to pass them to the script again during reinstallation. If you cannot remember which
options you used, read the contents of the `.environment` file and look for a `REINSTALL_OPTIONS` line. This line
contains a list of optional parameters.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart-static64.sh) --reinstall
```

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience problems with your Netdata Agent installation after following one of these processes, the next
best route is to [uninstall](/packaging/installer/UNINSTALL.md) and then try a fresh installation using the [one-line
installer](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md).
