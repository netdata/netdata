# Netdata Agent Installation

Netdata is very flexible and can be used to monitor all kinds of infrastructure. Read more about possible [Deployment guides](/docs/deployment-guides/README.md) to understand what better suites your needs.

## Install through Netdata Cloud

The easiest way to install Netdata on your system is via Netdata Cloud, to do so:

1. Sign in to <https://app.netdata.cloud/>.
2. Select a [Space](/docs/netdata-cloud/organize-your-infrastructure-invite-your-team.md#spaces), and click the "Connect Nodes" prompt, which will show the install command for your platform of choice.
3. Copy and paste the script into your node's terminal, and run it.

Once Netdata is installed, you can see the node live in your Netdata Space and charts in the [Metrics tab](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/metrics-tab-and-single-node-tabs.md).
