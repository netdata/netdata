# Install Netdata on Kubernetes

This document details how to install Netdata on an existing Kubernetes (k8s) cluster, and connect it to Netdata Cloud. Read our [Kubernetes visualizations](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/visualize/kubernetes.md) documentation, to see what you will get.

The [Netdata Helm chart](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart/blob/master/charts/netdata/README.md) installs one `parent` pod for storing metrics and managing alarm notifications, plus an additional
`child` pod for every node in the cluster, responsible for collecting metrics from the node, Kubernetes control planes,
pods/containers, and [supported application-specific
metrics](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#service-discovery-and-supported-services).

### Prerequisites

To deploy Kubernetes monitoring with Netdata, you need:

- A working cluster running Kubernetes v1.9 or newer.
- The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) command line tool, within [one minor version
    difference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/#before-you-begin) of your cluster, on an
    administrative system.
- The [Helm package manager](https://helm.sh/) v3.0.0 or newer on the same administrative system.
- A Netdata Cloud account with a Space to connect the cluster to.

## Deploy Netdata on your Kubernetes Cluster

First, you need to add the Netdata helm repository, and then install Netdata.  
The installation process securely connects your Kubernetes cluster to stream metrics data to Netdata Cloud, enabling Kubernetes-specific visualizations like the health map and time-series composite charts.

<h3> Install Netdata via the <code>helm install</code> command </h3>

#### Steps

1. Add the Netdata Helm chart repository by running:

  ```bash
  helm repo add netdata https://netdata.github.io/helmchart/
  ```

2. To install Netdata using the `helm install` command, run:

  ```bash
  helm install netdata netdata/netdata 
  ```

  > ### Note
  >  
  > If you plan to connect the node to Netdata Cloud, you can find the command with the right parameters by clicking the "Add Nodes" button in your Space's Nodes tab.

  For more installation options, please read our [Netdata Helm chart for Kubernetes](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart/blob/master/charts/netdata/README.md) reference.

#### Expected Result

Run `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get pods` to confirm that your cluster now runs a `netdata` service, one parent pod, and multiple child pods.

<h3> Connect an existing Netdata installation to Netdata Cloud </h3>

On an existing installation, in order to connect it to Netdata Cloud you will need to override the configuration values by running the `helm upgrade` command and provide a file with the values to override.

#### Steps

1. You can start with creating a file called `override.yml`

  ```bash
  touch override.yml
  ```
  
2. Paste the following into your `override.yml` file.

  ```yaml
  parent:
    claiming:
      enabled: true
      token: YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN
      rooms: YOUR_ROOM_ID_A,YOUR_ROOM_ID_B

  child:
    claiming:
      enabled: true
      token: YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN
      rooms: YOUR_ROOM_ID_A,YOUR_ROOM_ID_B
    configs:
      netdata:
        data: |
          [global]
            memory mode = ram
            history = 3600
          [health]
            enabled = no
  ```

  > :bookmark_tabs: Note
  >  
  > Make sure to replace `YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN` with the claim token of your space,
  > and `YOUR_ROOM_ID` with the ID of the room you are willing to connect to.

  These settings connect your `parent`/`child` nodes to Netdata Cloud and store more metrics in the nodes' time-series databases.

  > :bookmark_tabs: Info
  >  
  > These override settings, along with the Helm chart's defaults, will retain an hour's worth of metrics (`history = 3600`, or `3600 seconds`) on each child node. Based on your metrics retention needs, and the resources available on your cluster, you may want to increase the `history` setting.

3. To apply these new settings, run:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade -f override.yml netdata netdata/netdata
  ```

#### Expected Result

The cluster terminates the old pods and creates new ones with the proper persistence and connection configuration. You'll see your nodes, containers, and pods appear in Netdata Cloud in a few seconds.

If you don't need to configure your Netdata deployment, [skip down](#whats-next) to see how Kubernetes monitoring works
in Netdata, in addition to more guides and resources.

## Configure your Netdata monitoring deployment

Read up on the various configuration options in the [Helm chart
documentation](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#configuration) if you need to tweak your Kubernetes monitoring.

Your first option is to create an `override.yml` file, if you haven't created one already upon [deploying](#deploy-netdata-on-your-kubernetes-cluster), then apply the new configuration to your cluster with `helm
upgrade`.

```bash
helm upgrade -f override.yml netdata netdata/netdata
```

If you want to change only a single setting, use the `--set` argument with `helm upgrade`. For example, to change the
size of the persistent metrics volume on the parent node:

```bash
helm upgrade --set parent.database.volumesize=4Gi netdata netdata/netdata
```

### Configure service discovery

Netdata's [service discovery](https://github.com/netdata/agent-service-discovery/#service-discovery), installed as part
of the Helm chart installation, finds what services are running in a cluster's containers and automatically collects
service-level metrics from them.

Service discovery supports [popular applications](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#applications) and [Prometheus endpoints](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#prometheus-endpoints).

If your cluster runs services on non-default ports or uses non-default names, you may need to configure service
discovery to start collecting metrics from your services. You have to edit the default ConfigMap that is shipped with
the Helmchart and deploy that to your cluster.

First, copy the default file to your administrative system.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/helmchart/master/charts/netdata/sdconfig/child.yml -o child.yml
```

Edit the new `child.yml` file according to your needs. See the [Helm chart configuration](https://github.com/netdata/helmchart#configuration) and the file itself for details.

You can then run `helm upgrade` with the `--set-file` argument to use your configured `child.yml` file instead of the
default, changing the path if you copied it elsewhere.

```bash
helm upgrade --set-file sd.child.configmap.from.value=./child.yml netdata netdata/netdata
```

Now that you pushed an edited ConfigMap to your cluster, service discovery should find and set up metrics collection
from your non-default service.

## Update/reinstall the Netdata Helm chart

If you update the Helm chart's configuration, run `helm upgrade` to redeploy your Netdata service, replacing `netdata`
with the name of the release, if you changed it upon installation:

```bash
helm upgrade netdata netdata/netdata
```

To update Netdata's Helm chart to the latest version, run `helm repo update`, then deploy `upgrade` it`:

```bash
helm repo update
helm upgrade netdata netdata/netdata
```

## What's next?

[Start Kubernetes monitoring](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/visualize/kubernetes.md) in Netdata Cloud, which comes with meaningful visualizations out of the box.
