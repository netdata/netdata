The good news is that our [one-line installation script](kickstart.md) works fine if your NAS is one that uses the amd64 architecture. It
will install the content into `/opt/netdata`, making future removal safe and simple.

## Run as netdata user

When Netdata is first installed, it will run as _root_. This may or may not be acceptable for you, and since other
installations run it as the `netdata` user, you might wish to do the same. This requires some extra work:

1.  Create a group `netdata` via the Synology group interface. Give it no access to anything.
2.  Create a user `netdata` via the Synology user interface. Give it no access to anything and a random password. Assign
    the user to the `netdata` group. Netdata will chuid to this user when running.
3.  Change ownership of the following directories, as defined in [Netdata
    Security](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-security.md#security-design):

```sh
chown -R root:netdata /opt/netdata/usr/share/netdata
chown -R netdata:netdata /opt/netdata/var/lib/netdata /opt/netdata/var/cache/netdata
chown -R netdata:root /opt/netdata/var/log/netdata
```

4. Restart Netdata

```sh
/etc/rc.netdata restart
```

## Create startup script

Additionally, as of 2018/06/24, the Netdata installer doesn't recognize DSM as an operating system, so no init script is
installed. You'll have to do this manually:

1.  Add [this file](https://gist.github.com/oskapt/055d474d7bfef32c49469c1b53e8225f) as `/etc/rc.netdata`. Make it
    executable with `chmod 0755 /etc/rc.netdata`.
2.  Add or edit `/etc/rc.local` and add a line calling `/etc/rc.netdata` to have it start on boot:

```conf
# Netdata startup
[ -x /etc/rc.netdata ] && /etc/rc.netdata start
```

3. Make sure `/etc/rc.netdata` is executable: `chmod 0755 /etc/rc.netdata`.
