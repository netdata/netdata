# Installation methods

Netdata can be installed:

- [As a DEB/RPM package](/packaging/installer/methods/packages.md)
- [As a static binary](/packaging/makeself/README.md)
- [From a git checkout](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md)
- [As a docker container](/packaging/docker/README.md)

The [one line installer kickstart.sh](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md)
picks the most appropriate method out of the first three for any system
and is the recommended installation method, if you don't use containers.

`kickstart.sh` can also be used for [offline installation](/packaging/installer/methods/offline.md), suitable for air-gapped systems.
