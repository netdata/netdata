  You are about to install netdata to this system.
  netdata will be installed at:

                    /opt/netdata

  The following changes will be made to your system:

  # USERS / GROUPS
  User 'netdata' and group 'netdata' will be added, if not present.

  # LOGROTATE
  This file will be installed if logrotate is present.

   - /etc/logrotate.d/netdata

  # SYSTEM INIT
  This file will be installed if this system runs with systemd:

   - /lib/systemd/system/netdata.service

   or, for older CentOS, Debian/Ubuntu or OpenRC Gentoo:

   - /etc/init.d/netdata         will be created


  This package can also update a netdata installation that has been
  created with another version of it.

  Your netdata configuration will be retained.
  After installation, netdata will be (re-)started.

  netdata re-distributes a lot of open source software components.
  Check its full license at:
  https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/LICENSE.md

  Anonymous stat collection and reporting to Netdata is enabled
  by default. To disable, pass --disable-telemetry option to the installer
  or export the environment variable DISABLE_TELEMETRY to a non-zero or non-empty
  value (e.g export DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1).
