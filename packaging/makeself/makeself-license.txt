  You are about to install netdata to this system.
  netdata will be installed at:

                    /opt/netdata

  The following changes will be made to your system:

  # USERS / GROUPS
  User 'netdata' and group 'netdata' will be added, if not present.

  # LOGROTATE
  This file will be installed if logrotate is present.

   - /etc/logrotate.d/netdata

  # SYSTEM INIT
  If a supported init system is detected, appropriate configuration will be
  installed to allow Netdata to run as a system service. We currently support
  systemd, OpenRC, LSB init scripts, and traditional init.d setups, as well as
  having experimental support for runit.


  This package can also update a netdata installation that has been
  created with another version of it.

  Your netdata configuration will be retained.
  After installation, netdata will be (re-)started.

  netdata re-distributes a lot of open source software components.
