# Windows Installer Guide

Netdata provides a straightforward Windows installer for easy setup. The installer offers two installation modes, each with specific features outlined below.

**Important Note**: The Netdata Windows Agent is intended for users with paid Netdata subscriptions. If you're using a free account or no account at all, certain features of the Windows Agent will be restricted.

**Key Limitations for Free Users**:

- **Standalone Agents**: The user interface will be locked, and you will not have access to monitoring data.
- **Child Agents**: If the Windows Agent streams data to a Linux-based parent Netdata instance, you will be unable to view the Windows Agentâ€™s monitoring data in the parent dashboard.

## Download the MSI Installer

You can download the Netdata Windows installer (MSI) from the official releases page. Choose between the following versions:

## Silent Installation (Command Line)

Silent mode allows for automated deployments without user interaction.
