/*
 * Netdata DICTIONARY features:
 *
 * CLONE or LINK
 * Names and Values in the dictionary can be cloned or linked.
 * In clone mode, the dictionary does all the memory management.
 * The default is clone for both names and values.
 * Set DICTIONARY_FLAG_NAME_LINK_DONT_CLONE to link names.
 * Set DICTIONARY_FLAG_VALUE_LINK_DONT_CLONE to link names.
 *
 * ORDERED
 * Items are ordered in the order they are added (new items are appended at the end).
 * You may reverse the order by setting the flag DICTIONARY_FLAG_ADD_IN_FRONT.
 *
 * LOOKUP
 * The dictionary uses JudyHS to maintain a very fast randomly accessible hash table.
 *
 * MULTI-THREADED and SINGLE-THREADED
 * Each dictionary may be single threaded (no locks), or multi-threaded (multiple readers or one writer).
 * The default is multi-threaded. Add the flag DICTIONARY_FLAG_SINGLE_THREADED for single-threaded.
 *
 * WALK-THROUGH and FOREACH traversal
 * The dictionary can be traversed on read or write mode, either with a callback (walkthrough) or with
 * a loop (foreach).
 *
 * In write mode traversal, the caller may delete only the current item, but may add as many items as needed.
 *
