# netdata python.d.plugin configuration for smartd log
#
# This file is in YaML format. Generally the format is:
#
# name: value
#
# There are 2 sections:
#  - global variables
#  - one or more JOBS
#
# JOBS allow you to collect values from multiple sources.
# Each source will have its own set of charts.
#
# JOB parameters have to be indented (using spaces only, example below).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Variables
# These variables set the defaults for all JOBs, however each JOB
# may define its own, overriding the defaults.

# update_every sets the default data collection frequency.
# If unset, the python.d.plugin default is used.
# update_every: 1

# priority controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard.
# Lower numbers move the charts towards the top of the page.
# If unset, the default for python.d.plugin is used.
# priority: 60000

# retries sets the number of retries to be made in case of failures.
# If unset, the default for python.d.plugin is used.
# Attempts to restore the service are made once every update_every
# and only if the module has collected values in the past.
# retries: 5

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# JOBS (data collection sources)
#
# The default JOBS share the same *name*. JOBS with the same name
# are mutually exclusive. Only one of them will be allowed running at
# any time. This allows autodetection to try several alternatives and
# pick the one that works.
#
# Any number of jobs is supported.
#
# All python.d.plugin JOBS (for all its modules) support a set of
# predefined parameters. These are:
#
# job_name:
#     name: myname     # the JOB's name as it will appear at the
#                      # dashboard (by default is the job_name)
#                      # JOBs sharing a name are mutually exclusive
#     update_every: 1  # the JOB's data collection frequency
#     priority: 60000  # the JOB's order on the dashboard
#     retries: 5       # the JOB's number of restoration attempts
#
# Additionally to the above, smartd_log also supports the following:
#
#    log_path: '/path/to/smartdlogs'   # path to smartd log files. Default is /var/log/smartd
#    raw_values: no                    # raw or normalized values on charts. Default is normalized.
#    smart_attributes: '1 2 3 4 44'    # smart attributes charts. Default are ['1', '4', '5', '7', '9', '12', '193', '194', '197', '198', '200'].
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Additional information
#  Plugin reads smartd log files (-A option).
#  You need to add (man smartd) to /etc/default/smartmontools '-i 600 -A /var/log/smartd/' to pass additional options to smartd on startup
#  Then restart smartd service and check /path/log/smartdlogs
#  ls /var/log/smartd/

#
# Smartd APPEND logs at every run. Its NOT RECOMMENDED to set '-i' option below 60 sec.
# STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to create smartd conf file for logrotate
#
# RAW vs NORMALIZED values
# "Normalized value", commonly referred to as just "value". This is a most universal measurement, on the scale from 0 (bad) to some maximum (good) value.
# Maximum values are typically 100, 200 or 253. Rule of thumb is: high values are good, low values are bad.
#
# "Raw value" - the value of the attribute as it is tracked by the device, before any normalization takes place.
# Some raw numbers provide valuable insight when properly interpreted. These cases will be discussed later on.
# Raw values are typically listed in hexadecimal numbers. The raw value has different structure for different vendors and is often not meaningful as a decimal number.
