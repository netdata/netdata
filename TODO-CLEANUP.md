This is a live application developed by ai assistants. I have the impression that over time the application lost a few key principles:

1. separation of concerns (isolated modules that do not touch the internals of each other)
2. simplicity (refactors introduced transformations instead of completing the refactoring)
3. single point of reference (multiple similar functions with tiny or no differences)
4. unecessary complexity (features that could implemented in a much simpler way, but the assistants overcomplicated things)
5. bad practices, smelly code

I need you to:

1. Complete the thorough code review to identify a single, risk-free, consolidation, simplification, improvement on separation of concerns
2. Make sure this aspect is well tested before touching the code
3. Improve it
4. Make sure the tests still pass
5. Make sure documentation is updated as necessary

Do not ask any questions. If you have to ask questions, the candidate you picked is not right. We want only low-risk candidates that are obvious how to fix without breaking any of the existing features and functionality.

Append all you findings in this document.
