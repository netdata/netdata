      This integration requires read access to `/proc/slabinfo`, which is accessible only to the root user by
      default. Netdata uses Linux Capabilities to give the plugin access to this file. `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`
      is added automatically during installation. This capability allows bypassing file read permission checks
      and directory read and execute permission checks. If file capabilities are not usable, then the plugin is
      instead installed with the SUID bit set in permissions sVko that it runs as root.

        Due to the large number of metrics generated by this integration, it is disabled by default and must be
