# eBPF Process

Plugin: ebpf.plugin
Module: process

## Overview

Monitor internal memory usage.

Uses netdata internal statistic to monitor memory management by plugin.

This collector is only supported on the following platforms:

- Linux

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per eBPF Process instance

How plugin is allocating memory.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_size | memory | bytes |
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_alloc | aral | calls |
| netdata.ebpf_threads | total, running | threads |
| netdata.ebpf_load_methods | legacy, co-re | methods |
| netdata.ebpf_kernel_memory | memory_locked | bytes |
| netdata.ebpf_hash_tables_count | hash_table | hash tables |
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_size | memory | bytes |
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_alloc | aral | calls |
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_size | memory | bytes |
| netdata.ebpf_aral_stat_alloc | aral | calls |
| netdata.ebpf_hash_tables_insert_pid_elements | thread | rows |
| netdata.ebpf_hash_tables_remove_pid_elements | thread | rows |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.
