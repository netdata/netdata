#
# Global options
#
# The `ebpf load mode` option accepts the following values :
#  `entry` : The eBPF collector only monitors calls for the functions, and does not show charts related to errors.
#  `return : In the `return` mode, the eBPF collector monitors the same kernel functions as `entry`, but also creates
#            new charts for the return of these functions, such as errors.
#
# The eBPF collector also creates charts for each running application through an integration with the `apps plugin`.
# If you want to disable the integration with `apps.plugin` along with the above charts, change the setting `apps` to
# 'no'.
#
# The `update every` option defines the number of seconds used to read data from kernel and send to netdata
[global]
    ebpf load mode = entry
    apps = yes
    update every = 1

#
# eBPF Programs
#
# The eBPF collector enables and runs the following eBPF programs by default:
#
#  `cachestat`: Make charts for kernel functions related to page cache.
#  `process`  : This eBPF program creates charts that show information about process creation, VFS IO, and
#               files removed.
#  `socket`   : This eBPF program creates charts with information about `TCP` and `UDP` functions, including the
#               bandwidth consumed by each.
#  `sync`     : Montitor calls for syscall sync(2).
