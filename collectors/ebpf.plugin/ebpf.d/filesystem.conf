# The `ebpf load mode` option accepts the following values :
#  `entry` : The eBPF collector only monitors calls for the functions, and does not show charts related to errors.
#  `return : In the `return` mode, the eBPF collector monitors the same kernel functions as `entry`, but also creates
#            new charts for the return of these functions, such as errors.
#
# The `lifetime` defines the time length a thread will run when it is enabled by a function.
#
# The eBPF collector also creates charts for each running application through an integration with the `apps plugin`.
# If you want to disable the integration with `apps.plugin` along with the above charts, change the setting `apps` to
# 'no'.
#

    lifetime = 300
