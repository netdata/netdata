# The `ebpf load mode` option accepts the following values :
#  `entry` : The eBPF collector only monitors calls for the functions, and does not show charts related to errors.
#  `return : In the `return` mode, the eBPF collector monitors the same kernel functions as `entry`, but also creates
#            new charts for the return of these functions, such as errors.
#
# The `life time` defines the time length a thread will run when is enabled by a function.
#
[global]
#    ebpf load mode = entry
#    update every = 10
    life time = 300
