# The `ebpf load mode` option accepts the following values :
#  `entry` : The eBPF collector only monitors calls for the functions, and does not show charts related to errors.
#  `return : In the `return` mode, the eBPF collector monitors the same kernel functions as `entry`, but also creates
#            new charts for the return of these functions, such as errors.
#
# The `ebpf type format` option accepts the following values :
#  `auto`  : The eBPF collector will investigate hardware and select between the two next options.
#  `legacy`: The eBPF collector will load the legacy code. Note: This has a bigger overload.
#  `co-re` : The eBPF collector will use latest tracing method. Note: This is not available on all platforms.
#
# The `ebpf co-re tracing` option accepts the following values: 
#   `trampoline`: This is the default mode used by the eBPF collector, due the small overhead added to host.
#   `tracepoint`: When available, the eBPF collector will use kernel tracepoint to monitor syscall.
#   `probe`     : This is the same as legacy code.
#
# The `lifetime` defines the time length a thread will run when it is enabled by a function.
