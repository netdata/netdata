# freeipmi.plugin

Netdata has a [freeipmi](https://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/) plugin.

> FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification. The IPMI
> specification defines a set of interfaces for platform management and is implemented by a number vendors for system
> management. The features of IPMI that most users will be interested in are sensor monitoring, system event monitoring,
> power control, and serial-over-LAN (SOL).

## Installing the FreeIPMI plugin

When using our official DEB/RPM packages, the FreeIPMI plugin is included in a separate package named
`netdata-plugin-freeipmi` which needs to be manually installed using your system package manager. It is not
installed automatically due to the large number of dependencies it requires.

When using a static build of Netdata, the FreeIPMI plugin will be included and installed automatically, though
you will still need to have FreeIPMI installed on your system to be able to use the plugin.

When using a local build of Netdata, you need to ensure that the FreeIPMI development packages (typically
called `libipmimonitoring-dev`, `libipmimonitoring-devel`, or `freeipmi-devel`) are installed when building Netdata.

### Special Considerations

Accessing IPMI requires root access, so the FreeIPMI plugin is automatically installed setuid root.

FreeIPMI does not work correctly on IBM POWER systems, thus Netdataâ€™s FreeIPMI plugin is not usable on such systems.

If you have not previously used IPMI on your system, you will probably need to run the `ipmimonitoring` command as root
to initiailze IPMI settings so that the Netdata plugin works correctly. It should return information about available
seensors on the system.

In some distributions `libipmimonitoring.pc` is located in a non-standard directory, which
can cause building the plugin to fail when building Netdata from source. In that case you
should find the file and link it to the standard pkg-config directory. Usually, running `sudo ln -s
/usr/lib/$(uname -m)-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libipmimonitoring.pc/libipmimonitoring.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libipmimonitoring.pc`
resolves this issue.

## Metrics

The plugin does a speed test when it starts, to find out the duration needed by the IPMI processor to respond. Depending
on the speed of your IPMI processor, charts may need several seconds to show up on the dashboard.

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.

### global

These metrics refer to the monitored host.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric   | Dimensions |  Unit  |
|----------|:----------:|:------:|
| ipmi.sel |   events   | events |

### sensor

These metrics refer to the sensor.

Labels:

| Label     | Description                                                                                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sensor    | Sensor name. Same value as the "Name" column in the `ipmi-sensors` output.                                      |
| type      | Sensor type. Same value as the "Type" column in the `ipmi-sensors` output.                                      |
| component | General sensor component. Identified by Netdata based on sensor name and type (e.g. System, Processor, Memory). |

Metrics:

| ipmi.sensor_reading_percent |             percentage              |     %      |

## Alerts

There are 2 alerts:

- The sensor is in a warning or critical state.
- System Event Log (SEL) is non-empty.

## Configuration

The plugin supports a few options. To see them, run:

 Linux kernel module for IPMI is CPU hungry.
 On Linux run this to lower kipmiN CPU utilization:
 # echo 10 > /sys/module/ipmi_si/parameters/kipmid_max_busy_us

 or create: /etc/modprobe.d/ipmi.conf with these contents:
 options ipmi_si kipmid_max_busy_us=10

 For more information:
 https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/collectors/freeipmi.plugin
```

You can set these options in `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` at this section:

```
[plugin:freeipmi]
	update every = 5
	command options = 
```

Append to `command options =` the settings you need. The minimum `update every` is 5 (enforced internally by the
plugin). IPMI is slow and CPU hungry. So, once every 5 seconds is pretty acceptable.

## Ignoring specific sensors

Specific sensor IDs can be excluded from freeipmi tools by editing `/etc/freeipmi/freeipmi.conf` and setting the IDs to
be ignored at `ipmi-sensors-exclude-record-ids`. **However this file is not used by `libipmimonitoring`** (the library
used by Netdata's `freeipmi.plugin`).

So, `freeipmi.plugin` supports the option `ignore` that accepts a comma separated list of sensor IDs to ignore. To
configure it, edit `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` and set:

```
[plugin:freeipmi]
	command options = ignore 1,2,3,4,...
```

To find the IDs to ignore, run the command `ipmimonitoring`. The first column is the wanted ID:

```
ID  | Name             | Type                     | State    | Reading    | Units | Event
1   | Ambient Temp     | Temperature              | Nominal  | 26.00      | C     | 'OK'
2   | Altitude         | Other Units Based Sensor | Nominal  | 480.00     | ft    | 'OK'
3   | Avg Power        | Current                  | Nominal  | 100.00     | W     | 'OK'

15  | Fan 2            | Entity Presence          | Nominal  | N/A        | N/A   | 'Entity Present'
...
```

## Debugging

You can run the plugin by hand:

```sh
# become user netdata
sudo su -s /bin/sh netdata

# run the plugin in debug mode
/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/freeipmi.plugin 5 debug
```

You will get verbose output on what the plugin does.

## kipmi0 CPU usage

There have been reports that kipmi is showing increased CPU when the IPMI is queried. To lower the CPU consumption of
the system you can issue this command:

```sh
echo 10 > /sys/module/ipmi_si/parameters/kipmid_max_busy_us
```

You can also permanently set the above setting by creating the file `/etc/modprobe.d/ipmi.conf` with this content:

```sh
# prevent kipmi from consuming 100% CPU
options ipmi_si kipmid_max_busy_us=10
```

This instructs the kernel IPMI module to pause for a tick between checking IPMI. Querying IPMI will be a lot slower
now (e.g. several seconds for IPMI to respond), but `kipmi` will not use any noticeable CPU. You can also use a higher
number (this is the number of microseconds to poll IPMI for a response, before waiting for a tick).

If you need to disable IPMI for Netdata, edit `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf` and set:

```
[plugins]
    freeipmi = no
```
