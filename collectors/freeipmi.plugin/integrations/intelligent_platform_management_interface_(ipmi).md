# Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)

Plugin: freeipmi.plugin
Module: sensors

## Overview

"Monitor enterprise server sensor readings, event log entries, and hardware statuses to ensure reliable server operations."


The plugin uses open source library IPMImonitoring to communicate with sensors.


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.

The plugin needs setuid.

### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

Linux kernel module for IPMI can create big overhead.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per sensor



Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| sensor | The sensor name |
| type | One of 45 recognized sensor types (Battery, Voltage...) |
| component | One of 25 recognized components (Processor, Peripheral). |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| ipmi.sel | events | events |
| ipmi.sensor_state | nominal, critical, warning, unknown | state |
| ipmi.sensor_temperature_c | temperature | Celsius |
| ipmi.sensor_temperature_f | temperature | Fahrenheit |
| ipmi.sensor_voltage | voltage | Volts |
| ipmi.sensor_ampere | ampere | Amps |
| ipmi.sensor_fan_speed | rotations | RPM |
| ipmi.sensor_power | power | Watts |
| ipmi.sensor_reading_percent | percentage | % |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| [ ipmi_sensor_state ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/ipmi.conf) | ipmi.sensor_state | IPMI sensor ${label:sensor} (${label:component}) state |


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Preliminary actions

If you have not previously used IPMI on your system, you will probably need to run the ipmimonitoring command as root to initialize IPMI settings so that the Netdata plugin works correctly. It should return information about available sensors on the system.

In some distributions libipmimonitoring.pc is located in a non-standard directory, which can cause building the plugin to fail when building Netdata from source. In that case you should find the file and linking it to the standard pkg-config directory. Usually, running sudo ln -s /usr/lib/$(uname -m)-linux-gnu/pkgconfig/libipmimonitoring.pc/libipmimonitoring.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libipmimonitoring.pc resolves this issue.

If you installed `netdata` using a package manager, it is also necessary to install the package `netdata-plugin-freeimpi`.



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `netdata.conf`.
Configuration for this specific integration is located in the `[plugin:freeipmi]` section within that file.

The file format is a modified INI syntax. The general structure is:

```toml
[section1]
    option 1 = some value
    option 2 = some other value

[section2]
    option 3 = some third value
```
You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
```
#### Options

This tool receives command line options that are visible when user run: `./usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/freeipmi.plugin --help`

<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| command options | Variable used to pass arguments for the plugin. |  | False |

#### Examples
There are no configuration examples.
