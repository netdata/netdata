          CPU utilization, states and frequencies and key Linux system performance metrics.
          
          The `/proc/stat` file provides various types of system statistics:
          
          - The overall system CPU usage statistics
          - Per CPU core statistics
          - The total context switching of the system
          - The total number of processes running
          - The total CPU interrupts
          - The total CPU softirqs
          
          The collector also reads:
          
          - `/proc/schedstat` for statistics about the process scheduler in the Linux kernel.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/thermal_throttle/core_throttle_count` to get the count of thermal throttling events for a specific CPU core on Linux systems.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/thermal_throttle/package_throttle_count` to get the count of thermal throttling events for a specific CPU package on a Linux system.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq` to get the current operating frequency of a specific CPU core.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/cpufreq/stats/time_in_state` to get the amount of time the CPU has spent in each of its available frequency states.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/cpuidle/state[X]/name` to get the names of the idle states for each CPU core in a Linux system.
          - `/sys/devices/system/cpu/[X]/cpuidle/state[X]/time` to get the total time each specific CPU core has spent in each idle state since the system was started.

          Entropy, a measure of the randomness or unpredictability of data.
          
          In the context of cryptography, entropy is used to generate random numbers or keys that are essential for
          secure communication and encryption. Without a good source of entropy, cryptographic protocols can become
          vulnerable to attacks that exploit the predictability of the generated keys.
          
          In most operating systems, entropy is generated by collecting random events from various sources, such as
          hardware interrupts, mouse movements, keyboard presses, and disk activity. These events are fed into a pool
          of entropy, which is then used to generate random numbers when needed.
          
          The `/dev/random` device in Linux is one such source of entropy, and it provides an interface for programs
          to access the pool of entropy. When a program requests random numbers, it reads from the `/dev/random` device,
          which blocks until enough entropy is available to generate the requested numbers. This ensures that the
          generated numbers are truly random and not predictable. 
          
          However, if the pool of entropy gets depleted, the `/dev/random` device may block indefinitely, causing
          programs that rely on random numbers to slow down or even freeze. This is especially problematic for
          cryptographic protocols that require a continuous stream of random numbers, such as SSL/TLS and SSH.
          
          To avoid this issue, some systems use a hardware random number generator (RNG) to generate high-quality
          entropy. A hardware RNG generates random numbers by measuring physical phenomena, such as thermal noise or
          radioactive decay. These sources of randomness are considered to be more reliable and unpredictable than
          software-based sources.
          
          One such hardware RNG is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is a dedicated hardware chip that is used
          for cryptographic operations and secure boot. The TPM contains a built-in hardware RNG that generates
          high-quality entropy, which can be used to seed the pool of entropy in the operating system.
          
          Alternatively, software-based solutions such as `Haveged` can be used to generate additional entropy by
          exploiting sources of randomness in the system, such as CPU utilization and network traffic. These solutions
          can help to mitigate the risk of entropy depletion, but they may not be as reliable as hardware-based solutions.

          The amount of time the system has been up (running).
          
          Uptime is a critical aspect of overall system performance:
          
          - **Availability**: Uptime monitoring can show whether a server is consistently available or experiences frequent downtimes.
          - **Performance Monitoring**: While server uptime alone doesn't provide detailed performance data, analyzing the duration and frequency of downtimes can help identify patterns or trends.
          - **Proactive problem detection**: If server uptime monitoring reveals unexpected downtimes or a decreasing uptime trend, it can serve as an early warning sign of potential problems.
          - **Root cause analysis**: When investigating server downtime, the uptime metric alone may not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact cause.
          - **Load balancing**: Uptime data can indirectly indicate load balancing issues if certain servers have significantly lower uptimes than others.
          - **Optimize maintenance efforts**: Servers with consistently low uptimes or frequent downtimes may require more attention.
          - **Compliance requirements**: Server uptime data can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements or SLAs that mandate a minimum level of server availability.

          Information about memory management, indicating how effectively the kernel allocates and frees
          memory resources in response to system demands.
          
          Monitors page faults, which occur when a process requests a portion of its memory that isn't
          immediately available. Monitoring these events can help diagnose inefficiencies in memory management and
          provide insights into application behavior.
          
          Tracks swapping activity — a vital aspect of memory management where the kernel moves data from RAM to
          swap space, and vice versa, based on memory demand and usage. It also monitors the utilization of zswap,
          a compressed cache for swap pages, and provides insights into its usage and performance implications.
          
          In the context of virtualized environments, it tracks the ballooning mechanism which is used to balance
          memory resources between host and guest systems.
          
          For systems using NUMA architecture, it provides insights into the local and remote memory accesses, which
          can impact the performance based on the memory access times.

          The collector also watches for 'Out of Memory' kills, a drastic measure taken by the system when it runs out
          of memory resources.

          Monitors `/proc/interrupts`, a file organized by CPU and then by the type of interrupt.
          The numbers reported are the counts of the interrupts that have occurred of each type.

          An interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs
          immediate attention. The processor then interrupts its current activities and executes the interrupt handler
          to deal with the event. This is part of the way a computer multitasks and handles concurrent processing.
          
          The types of interrupts include:

          - **I/O interrupts**: These are caused by I/O devices like the keyboard, mouse, printer, etc. For example, when
            you type something on the keyboard, an interrupt is triggered so the processor can handle the new input.

          - **Timer interrupts**: These are generated at regular intervals by the system's timer circuit. It's primarily
            used to switch the CPU among different tasks.

          - **Software interrupts**: These are generated by a program requiring disk I/O operations, or other system resources.

          - **Hardware interrupts**: These are caused by hardware conditions such as power failure, overheating, etc.
          
          Monitoring `/proc/interrupts` can be used for:

          - **Performance tuning**: If an interrupt is happening very frequently, it could be a sign that a device is not
            configured correctly, or there is a software bug causing unnecessary interrupts. This could lead to system
            performance degradation.

          - **System troubleshooting**: If you're seeing a lot of unexpected interrupts, it could be a sign of a hardware problem.

          - **Understanding system behavior**: More generally, keeping an eye on what interrupts are occurring can help you
            understand what your system is doing. It can provide insights into the system's interaction with hardware,
            drivers, and other parts of the kernel.

          The `/proc/loadavg` file provides information about the system load average.
          
          The load average is a measure of the amount of computational work that a system performs. It is a
          representation of the average system load over a period of time.

          This file contains three numbers representing the system load averages for the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes,
          respectively. It also includes the currently running processes and the total number of processes.
          
          Monitoring the load average can be used for:

          - **System performance**: If the load average is too high, it may indicate that your system is overloaded.
            On a system with a single CPU, if the load average is 1, it means the single CPU is fully utilized. If the
            load averages are consistently higher than the number of CPUs/cores, it may indicate that your system is
            overloaded and tasks are waiting for CPU time.

          - **Troubleshooting**: If the load average is unexpectedly high, it can be a sign of a problem. This could be
            due to a runaway process, a software bug, or a hardware issue.

          - **Capacity planning**: By monitoring the load average over time, you can understand the trends in your
            system's workload. This can help with capacity planning and scaling decisions.

          Remember that load average not only considers CPU usage, but also includes processes waiting for disk I/O.
          Therefore, high load averages could be due to I/O contention as well as CPU contention.

          Introduced in Linux kernel 4.20, `/proc/pressure` provides information about system pressure stall information
          (PSI). PSI is a feature that allows the system to track the amount of time the system is stalled due to
          resource contention, such as CPU, memory, or I/O.

          The collectors monitored 3 separate files for CPU, memory, and I/O:

          - **cpu**: Tracks the amount of time tasks are stalled due to CPU contention.
          - **memory**: Tracks the amount of time tasks are stalled due to memory contention.
          - **io**: Tracks the amount of time tasks are stalled due to I/O contention.
          - **irq**: Tracks the amount of time tasks are stalled due to IRQ contention.
          
          Each of them provides metrics for stall time over the last 10 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes.
          
          Monitoring the /proc/pressure files can provide important insights into system performance and capacity planning:
          
          - **Identifying resource contention**: If these metrics are consistently high, it indicates that tasks are
            frequently being stalled due to lack of resources, which can significantly degrade system performance.
          
          - **Troubleshooting performance issues**: If a system is experiencing performance issues, these metrics can
            help identify whether resource contention is the cause.

          - **Capacity planning**: By monitoring these metrics over time, you can understand trends in resource
            utilization and make informed decisions about when to add more resources to your system.

        metrics_description: |
          In the Linux kernel, handling of hardware interrupts is split into two halves: the top half and the bottom half.
          The top half is the routine that responds immediately to an interrupt, while the bottom half is deferred to be processed later.
          
          Softirqs are a mechanism in the Linux kernel used to handle the bottom halves of interrupts, which can be
          deferred and processed later in a context where it's safe to enable interrupts.
          
          The actual work of handling the interrupt is offloaded to a softirq and executed later when the system
          decides it's a good time to process them. This helps to keep the system responsive by not blocking the top
          half for too long, which could lead to missed interrupts.
          
          Monitoring `/proc/softirqs` is useful for:

          - **Performance tuning**: A high rate of softirqs could indicate a performance issue. For instance, a high
            rate of network softirqs (`NET_RX` and `NET_TX`) could indicate a network performance issue.

          - **Troubleshooting**: If a system is behaving unexpectedly, checking the softirqs could provide clues about
            what is going on. For example, a sudden increase in block device softirqs (BLOCK) might indicate a problem
            with a disk.

          - **Understanding system behavior**: Knowing what types of softirqs are happening can help you understand what
            your system is doing, particularly in terms of how it's interacting with hardware and how it's handling
            interrupts.

          `/proc/net/softnet_stat` provides statistics that relate to the handling of network packets by softirq.
          
          It provides information about:
          
          - Total number of processed packets (`processed`).
          - Times ksoftirq ran out of quota (`dropped`).
          - Times net_rx_action was rescheduled.
          - Number of times processed all lists before quota.
          - Number of times did not process all lists due to quota.
          - Number of times net_rx_action was rescheduled for GRO (Generic Receive Offload) cells.
          - Number of times GRO cells were processed.
          
          Monitoring the /proc/net/softnet_stat file can be useful for:
          
          - **Network performance monitoring**: By tracking the total number of processed packets and how many packets
            were dropped, you can gain insights into your system's network performance.
          
          - **Troubleshooting**: If you're experiencing network-related issues, this collector can provide valuable clues.
            For instance, a high number of dropped packets may indicate a network problem.
          
          - **Capacity planning**: If your system is consistently processing near its maximum capacity of network
            packets, it might be time to consider upgrading your network infrastructure.

          `/proc/meminfo` provides detailed information about the system's current memory usage. It includes information
          about different types of memory, RAM, Swap, ZSwap, HugePages, Transparent HugePages (THP), Kernel memory,
          SLAB memory, memory mappings, and more.
          
          Monitoring /proc/meminfo can be useful for:

          - **Performance Tuning**: Understanding your system's memory usage can help you make decisions about system
            tuning and optimization. For example, if your system is frequently low on free memory, it might benefit
            from more RAM.
          
          - **Troubleshooting**: If your system is experiencing problems, `/proc/meminfo` can provide clues about
            whether memory usage is a factor. For example, if your system is slow and cached swap is high, it could
            mean that your system is swapping out a lot of memory to disk, which can degrade performance.
          
          - **Capacity Planning**: By monitoring memory usage over time, you can understand trends and make informed
            decisions about future capacity needs.

          The Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) subsystem is detecting and reporting errors in the system's memory,

          The collector provides data for:
          
          - Per memory controller (MC): correctable and uncorrectable errors. These can be of 2 kinds:
            - errors related to a DIMM
            - errors that cannot be associated with a DIMM
          
          - Per memory DIMM: correctable and uncorrectable errors. There are 2 kinds:
            - memory controllers that can identify the physical DIMMS and report errors directly for them,
            - memory controllers that report errors for memory address ranges that can be linked to dimms.
              In this case the DIMMS reported may be more than the physical DIMMS installed.

          Information about NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) nodes on the system.
          
          NUMA is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can
          share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded. NUMA is used in a
          symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) system.

          In a NUMA system, processors, memory, and I/O devices are grouped together into cells, also known as nodes.
          Each node has its own memory and set of I/O devices, and one or more processors. While a processor can access
          memory in any of the nodes, it does so faster when accessing memory within its own node.

          The collector provides statistics on memory allocations for processes running on the NUMA nodes, revealing the
          efficiency of memory allocations in multi-node systems.

          Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) is a memory-saving feature in Linux that enables the kernel to examine the
          memory of different processes and identify identical pages. It then merges these identical pages into a
          single page that the processes share. This is particularly useful for virtualization, where multiple virtual
          machines might be running the same operating system or applications and have many identical pages.
          
          The collector provides information about the operation and effectiveness of KSM on your system.

          IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. It is a mechanism which allows processes to communicate with each
          other and synchronize their actions.
          
          This collector exposes information about:

          - Message Queues: This allows messages to be exchanged between processes. It's a more flexible method that
            allows messages to be placed onto a queue and read at a later time.

          - Shared Memory: This method allows for the fastest form of IPC because processes can exchange data by
            reading/writing into shared memory segments.

          - Semaphores: They are used to synchronize the operations performed by independent processes. So, if multiple
            processes are trying to access a single shared resource, semaphores can ensure that only one process
            accesses the resource at a given time.
