# Network interfaces

Plugin: proc.plugin
Module: /proc/net/dev

## Overview

Monitor network interface metrics about bandwidth, state, errors and more.



This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Network interfaces instance



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| system.net | received, sent | kilobits/s |

### Per network device



Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| interface_type | TBD |
| device | TBD |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| net.net | received, sent | kilobits/s |
| net.speed | speed | kilobits/s |
| net.duplex | full, half, unknown | state |
| net.operstate | up, down, notpresent, lowerlayerdown, testing, dormant, unknown | state |
| net.carrier | up, down | state |
| net.mtu | mtu | octets |
| net.packets | received, sent, multicast | packets/s |
| net.errors | inbound, outbound | errors/s |
| net.drops | inbound, outbound | drops/s |
| net.fifo | receive, transmit | errors |
| net.compressed | received, sent | packets/s |
| net.events | frames, collisions, carrier | events/s |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:
