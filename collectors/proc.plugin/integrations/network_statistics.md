# Network statistics

Plugin: proc.plugin
Module: /proc/net/netstat

## Overview

This integration provides metrics from the `netstat`, `snmp` and `snmp6` modules.



This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Network statistics instance



This scope has no labels.

| [ 1m_tcp_accept_queue_overflows ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/tcp_listen.conf) | ip.tcp_accept_queue | average number of overflows in the TCP accept queue over the last minute |
| [ 1m_tcp_accept_queue_drops ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/tcp_listen.conf) | ip.tcp_accept_queue | average number of dropped packets in the TCP accept queue over the last minute |

| [ 10s_ipv4_tcp_resets_received ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/tcp_resets.conf) | ipv4.tcphandshake | average number of received TCP RESETS over the last 10 seconds. This can be an indication that a service this host needs has crashed. Netdata will not send a clear notification for this alarm. |
