# System Uptime

Plugin: proc.plugin
Module: /proc/uptime

## Overview

The amount of time the system has been up (running).

Uptime is a critical aspect of overall system performance:

- **Availability**: Uptime monitoring can show whether a server is consistently available or experiences frequent downtimes.
- **Performance Monitoring**: While server uptime alone doesn't provide detailed performance data, analyzing the duration and frequency of downtimes can help identify patterns or trends.
- **Proactive problem detection**: If server uptime monitoring reveals unexpected downtimes or a decreasing uptime trend, it can serve as an early warning sign of potential problems.
- **Root cause analysis**: When investigating server downtime, the uptime metric alone may not provide enough information to pinpoint the exact cause.
- **Load balancing**: Uptime data can indirectly indicate load balancing issues if certain servers have significantly lower uptimes than others.
- **Optimize maintenance efforts**: Servers with consistently low uptimes or frequent downtimes may require more attention.
- **Compliance requirements**: Server uptime data can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements or SLAs that mandate a minimum level of server availability.




This collector is only supported on the following platforms:

- linux

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per System Uptime instance



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| system.uptime | uptime | seconds |
