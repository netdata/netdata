          - title: Libraries
            description: |
              1. Install `xen-dom0-libs-devel` and `yajl-devel` using the package manager of your system.
              
                Note: On Cent-OS systems you will need `centos-release-xen` repository and the required package for xen is `xen-devel`
              
              2. Re-install Netdata from source. The installer will detect that the required libraries are now available and will also build xenstat.plugin.
