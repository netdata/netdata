# Idle OS Jitter

Plugin: idlejitter.plugin
Module: idlejitter.plugin

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

Monitor delays in timing for user processes caused by scheduling limitations to optimize the system to run latency sensitive applications with minimal jitter, improving consistency and quality of service.


A thread is spawned that requests to sleep for fixed amount of time. When the system wakes it up, it measures how many microseconds have passed. The difference between the requested and the actual duration of the sleep, is the idle jitter. This is done dozens of times per second to ensure we have a representative sample.


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration will run by default on all supported systems.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Idle OS Jitter instance



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| system.idlejitter | min, max, average | microseconds lost/s |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `netdata.conf`.

The file format is a modified INI syntax. The general structure is:

```toml
[section1]
    option 1 = some value
    option 2 = some other value

[section2]
    option 3 = some third value
```
You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
```
#### Options

This integration only supports a single configuration option, and most users will not need to change it.


| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| loop time in ms | Specifies the target time for the data collection thread to sleep, measured in miliseconds.
 |  | False |

#### Examples
There are no configuration examples.
