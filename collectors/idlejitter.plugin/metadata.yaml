        metrics_description: >
          Monitor delays in timing for user processes caused by scheduling limitations to optimize the system to run
          latency sensitive applications with minimal jitter, improving consistency and quality of service.
        method_description: >
          A thread is spawned that requests to sleep for fixed amount of time. When the system wakes it up, it
          measures how many microseconds have passed. The difference between the requested and the actual duration of
          the sleep, is the idle jitter. This is done dozens of times per second to ensure we have a representative sample.
