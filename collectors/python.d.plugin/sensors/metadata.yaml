        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
