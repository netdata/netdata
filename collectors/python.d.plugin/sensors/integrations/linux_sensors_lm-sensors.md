# Linux Sensors (lm-sensors)

Plugin: python.d.plugin
Module: sensors

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

Examine Linux Sensors metrics with Netdata for insights into hardware health and performance.

Enhance your system's reliability with real-time hardware health insights.


Reads system sensors information (temperature, voltage, electric current, power, etc.) via [lm-sensors](https://hwmon.wiki.kernel.org/lm_sensors).


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

The following type of sensors are auto-detected:
- temperature - fan - voltage - current - power - energy - humidity


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per chip

Metrics related to chips. Each chip provides a set of the following metrics, each having the chip name in the metric name as reported by `sensors -u`.


This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| sensors.temperature | a dimension per sensor | Celsius |
| sensors.voltage | a dimension per sensor | Volts |
| sensors.current | a dimension per sensor | Ampere |
| sensors.power | a dimension per sensor | Watt |
| sensors.fan | a dimension per sensor | Rotations/min |
| sensors.energy | a dimension per sensor | Joule |
| sensors.humidity | a dimension per sensor | Percent |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `python.d/sensors.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config python.d/sensors.conf
```
#### Options

There are 2 sections:

* Global variables
* One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| types | The types of sensors to collect. | temperature, fan, voltage, current, power, energy, humidity | True |
| update_every | Sets the default data collection frequency. | 1 | False |
| priority | Controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard. | 60000 | False |
| autodetection_retry | Sets the job re-check interval in seconds. | 0 | False |
| penalty | Indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures. | yes | False |

</details>

#### Examples

##### Default

Default configuration.

```yaml
types:
  - temperature
  - fan
  - voltage
  - current
  - power
  - energy
  - humidity

```


## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `sensors` collector, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `python.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./python.d.plugin sensors debug trace
  ```
