# Linux machine sensors monitoring with Netdata

Reads system sensors information (temperature, voltage, electric current, power, etc.).

Charts are created dynamically.

## Configuration

Edit the `python.d/sensors.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the Netdata [config
directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config python.d/sensors.conf
```

### possible issues

There have been reports from users that on certain servers, ACPI ring buffer errors are printed by the kernel (`dmesg`) 
when ACPI sensors are being accessed. We are tracking such cases in 
issue [#827](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/827). Please join this discussion for help.

When `lm-sensors` doesn't work on your device (e.g. for RPi temperatures), 
use [the legacy bash collector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/collectors/charts.d.plugin/sensors/README.md)


### Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `sensors` module, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The 
output will give you the output of the data collection job or error messages on why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins directory, usually they are located under `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's 
not the case on your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the 
plugin's directory, switch to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo su -s /bin/bash netdata
```

Now you can manually run the `sensors` module in debug mode:

```bash
./python.d.plugin sensors debug trace
```
