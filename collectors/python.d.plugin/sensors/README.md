# Linux machine sensors monitoring with Netdata

Reads system sensors information (temperature, voltage, electric current, power, etc.).

Charts are created dynamically.

## Configuration

Edit the `python.d/sensors.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the Netdata [config
directory](/docs/configure/nodes.md), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config python.d/sensors.conf
```

### possible issues

There have been reports from users that on certain servers, ACPI ring buffer errors are printed by the kernel (`dmesg`) when ACPI sensors are being accessed.
We are tracking such cases in issue [#827](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/827).
Please join this discussion for help.
