      - title: Provide Netdata the permissions to run the command
        description: |
          Netdata must have permissions to run the `nsd-control stats_noreset` command.

          You can:

          - Add "netdata" user to "nsd" group:
            ```
            usermod -aG nsd netdata
            ```
          - Add Netdata to sudoers
            1. Edit the sudoers file:
              ```
              visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/netdata
              ```
            2. Add the entry:
              ```
              Defaults:netdata   !requiretty
              netdata ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nsd-control stats_noreset
              ```
            
            > Note that you will need to set the `command` option to `sudo /usr/sbin/nsd-control stats_noreset` if you use this method.

      description: |
        This particular collector does not need further configuration to work if permissions are satisfied, but you can always customize it's data collection behavior.

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
