            description: |
              Netdata must have permissions to run the `nsd-control stats_noreset` command.
              
              You can:
              
              - Add "netdata" user to "nsd" group:
                ```
                usermod -aG nsd netdata
                ```
              - Add Netdata to sudoers
                1. Edit the sudoers file:
                  ```
                  visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/netdata
                  ```
                2. Add the entry:
                  ```
                  Defaults:netdata   !requiretty
                  netdata ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nsd-control stats_noreset
                  ```
              
                > Note that you will need to set the `command` option to `sudo /usr/sbin/nsd-control stats_noreset` if you use this method.

          description: |
            This particular collector does not need further configuration to work if permissions are satisfied, but you can always customize it's data collection behavior.
            
            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
