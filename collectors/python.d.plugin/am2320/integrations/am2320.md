# AM2320

Plugin: python.d.plugin
Module: am2320

## Overview

This collector monitors AM2320 sensor metrics about temperature and humidity.

It retrieves temperature and humidity values by contacting an AM2320 sensor over i2c.

This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

Assuming prerequisites are met, the collector will try to connect to the sensor via i2c

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per AM2320 instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| am2320.temperature | temperature | celsius |
| am2320.humidity | humidity | percentage |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Sensor connection to a Raspberry Pi

Connect the am2320 to the Raspberry Pi I2C pins

Raspberry Pi 3B/4 Pins:

- Board 3.3V (pin 1) to sensor VIN (pin 1)
- Board SDA (pin 3) to sensor SDA (pin 2)
- Board GND (pin 6) to sensor GND (pin 3)
- Board SCL (pin 5) to sensor SCL (pin 4)

You may also need to add two I2C pullup resistors if your board does not already have them. The Raspberry Pi does have internal pullup resistors but it doesn't hurt to add them anyway. You can use 2.2K - 10K but we will just use 10K. The resistors go from VDD to SCL and SDA each.


#### Software requirements

Install the Adafruit Circuit Python AM2320 library:

`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-am2320`



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `python.d/am2320.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config python.d/am2320.conf
```
#### Options

There are 2 sections:

* Global variables
* One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Sets the default data collection frequency. |  | False |
| priority | Controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard. |  | False |
| autodetection_retry | Sets the job re-check interval in seconds. |  | False |
| penalty | Indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures. |  | False |
| name | Job name. This value will overwrite the `job_name` value. JOBS with the same name are mutually exclusive. Only one of them will be allowed running at any time. This allows autodetection to try several alternatives and pick the one that works. |  | False |

</details>

#### Examples

##### Local sensor

A basic JOB configuration

```yaml
local_sensor:
  name: 'Local AM2320'

```


## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `am2320` collector, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `python.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./python.d.plugin am2320 debug trace
  ```
