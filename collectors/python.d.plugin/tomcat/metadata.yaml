            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
