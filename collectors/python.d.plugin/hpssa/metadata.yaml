      - title: 'Allow user netdata to execute `ssacli` as root.'
        description: |
          This module uses `ssacli`, which can only be executed by root. It uses `sudo` and assumes that it is configured such that the `netdata` user can execute `ssacli` as root without a password.

          - Add to your `/etc/sudoers` file:

          `which ssacli` shows the full path to the binary.

          ```bash
          netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/ssacli
          ```

          - Reset Netdata's systemd
            unit [CapabilityBoundingSet](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Capabilities) (Linux
            distributions with systemd)

          The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using `sudo`, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute `ssacli` using `sudo`.

          As the `root` user, do the following:

          ```cmd
          mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
          echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
          systemctl daemon-reload
          systemctl restart netdata.service
          ```

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
