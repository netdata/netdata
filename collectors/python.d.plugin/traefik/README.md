# Traefik monitoring with Netdata

Uses the `health` API to provide statistics.

It produces:

1. **Responses** by statuses

    - success (1xx, 2xx, 304)
    - error (5xx)
    - redirect (3xx except 304)
    - bad (4xx)
    - other (all other responses)

2. **Responses** by codes

    - 2xx (successful)
    - 5xx (internal server errors)
    - 3xx (redirect)
    - 4xx (bad)
    - 1xx (informational)
    - other (non-standart responses)

3. **Detailed Response Codes** requests/s (number of responses for each response code family individually)

4. **Requests**/s

    - request statistics

5. **Total response time**

    - sum of all response time

6. **Average response time**

7. **Average response time per iteration**

8. **Uptime**

    - Traefik server uptime

## Configuration

Edit the `python.d/traefik.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md), which is typically
at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config python.d/traefik.conf
```

Needs only `url` to server's `health`

Here is an example for local server:

```yaml
update_every: 1
priority: 60000

local:
  url: 'http://localhost:8080/health'
```

Without configuration, module attempts to connect to `http://localhost:8080/health`.




### Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `traefik` module, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The 
output will give you the output of the data collection job or error messages on why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins directory, usually they are located under `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's 
not the case on your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the 
plugin's directory, switch to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo su -s /bin/bash netdata
```

Now you can manually run the `traefik` module in debug mode:

```bash
./python.d.plugin traefik debug trace
```
