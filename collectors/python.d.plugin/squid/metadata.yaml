            description: |
              Take a look at [Squid's official documentation](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/CacheManager/Index#controlling-access-to-the-cache-manager) on how to configure access to the Cache Manager.

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
