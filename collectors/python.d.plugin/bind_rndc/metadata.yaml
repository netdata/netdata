            description: |
              BIND appends logs at EVERY RUN. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to set `update_every` below 30 sec.
              It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to create a `bind-rndc.conf` file for logrotate.
              
              To set up BIND to dump stats do the following:
              
              1. Add to 'named.conf.options' options {}:
              `statistics-file "/var/log/bind/named.stats";`
              
              2. Create bind/ directory in /var/log:
              `cd /var/log/ && mkdir bind`
              
              3. Change owner of directory to 'bind' user:
              `chown bind bind/`
              
              4. RELOAD (NOT restart) BIND:
              `systemctl reload bind9.service`
              
              5. Run as a root 'rndc stats' to dump (BIND will create named.stats in new directory)
              
              To allow Netdata to run 'rndc stats' change '/etc/bind/rndc.key' group to netdata:
              `chown :netdata rndc.key`
              
              Last, BUT NOT least, is to create bind-rndc.conf in logrotate.d/:
              ```
              /var/log/bind/named.stats {
              
                  daily
                  rotate 4
                  compress
                  delaycompress
                  create 0644 bind bind
                  missingok
                  postrotate
                      rndc reload > /dev/null
                  endscript
              }
              ```
              To test your logrotate conf file run as root:
              `logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/bind-rndc -d (debug dry-run mode)`

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
