  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Enable the Remote Console Protocol
        description: |
          Under your SpigotMC server's `server.properties` configuration file, you should set `enable-rcon` to `true`.

          This will allow the Server to listen and respond to queries over the rcon protocol.
  configuration:
    file:
      name: "python.d/spigotmc.conf"

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
