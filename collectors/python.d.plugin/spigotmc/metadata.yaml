          - title: Enable the Remote Console Protocol
            description: |
              Under your SpigotMC server's `server.properties` configuration file, you should set `enable-rcon` to `true`.
              
              This will allow the Server to listen and respond to queries over the rcon protocol.

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
