      exposes
  platforms:
    description: If this collector can't run on some platforms specify them here and
      set it to false, otherwise set this to true and this text will not be rendered,
      instead a templated message will appear

  related:
    description: give a simple description if there are any other collectors related
      to this collector. Example -> To get the most out of your apache servers, you
      can monitor its processes for resources utilization and their log files to turn
      them into real-time metrics. Check our related resources for more information.

    impact:
      description: Is there any impact on the application when using the default configuration?
        Maybe on a db collector having to many tables might slow down the db if collection
