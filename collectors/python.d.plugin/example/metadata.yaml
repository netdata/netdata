          Example collector that generates some random numbers as metrics.
          
          If you want to write your own collector, read our [writing a new Python module](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/collectors/python.d.plugin/README.md#how-to-write-a-new-module) tutorial.
        method_description: |
          The `get_data()` function uses `random.randint()` to generate a random number which will be collected as a metric.

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
