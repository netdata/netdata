    metrics_description: |
      Example collector that generates some random numbers as metrics.

      If you want to write your own collector, read our [writing a new Python module](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/collectors/python.d.plugin/README.md#how-to-write-a-new-module) tutorial.
    method_description: |
      The `get_data()` function uses `random.randint()` to generate a random number which will be collected as a metric.

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
