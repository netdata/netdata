overview:
  operation:
    description: This collector periodically does http requests to one or more {[Apache](link
      to collector)} (<- CI will remove the curly brackets, they are for replacing
      with the virtual integrations, to replace the link each time) web servers to
      collect the metrics mod_status plugin that apache exposes
  platforms:
    description: If this collector can't run on some platforms specify them here and
      set it to false, otherwise set this to true and this text will not be rendered,
      instead a templated message will appear
    use_templated_text: true
  multi-instance:
    boolean: true
  permissions:
    description: if there are any notable permission requirements, eg running as root
      and so on, specify them here and set it to false, otherwise set it to true and
      a templated message will appear
    use_templated_text: true
  related:
    description: give a simple description if there are any other collectors related
      to this collector. Example -> To get the most out of your apache servers, you
      can monitor its processes for resources utilization and their log files to turn
      them into real-time metrics. Check our related resources for more information.

  behavior:
    auto_detection:
      description: The collector auto-detects apache web servers running on localhost
        ports 80, 443, and 8080.
    limits:
      description: The collector is limited to x amount of tables or any other limitation,
        leave empty if none
    impact:
      description: Is there any impact on the application when using the default configuration?
        Maybe on a db collector having to many tables might slow down the db if collection
        happens per second, leave empty if none
