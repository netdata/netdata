          This collector monitors Varnish metrics about HTTP accelerator global, Backends (VBE) and Storages (SMF, SMA, MSE) statistics.
          
          Note that both, Varnish-Cache (free and open source) and Varnish-Plus (Commercial/Enterprise version), are supported.

              In order for the collector to work, you need to add the `netdata` user to the `varnish` user group, so that it can execute the `varnishstat` tool:
              
              ```
              usermod -aG varnish netdata
              ```

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
