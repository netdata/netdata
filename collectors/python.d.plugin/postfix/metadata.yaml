      Postfix has internal access controls that limit activities on the mail queue. By default, all users are allowed to view
      the queue. If your system is configured with stricter access controls, you need to grant the `netdata` user access to
      view the mail queue. In order to do it, add `netdata` to `authorized_mailq_users` in the `/etc/postfix/main.cf` file.

      See the `authorized_mailq_users` setting in
      the [Postfix documentation](https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html) for more details.

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
