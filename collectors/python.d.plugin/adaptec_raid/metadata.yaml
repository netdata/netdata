        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors Adaptec RAID hardware storage controller metrics about both physical and logical drives.
        method_description: |
          It uses the arcconf command line utility (from adaptec) to monitor your raid controller.
          
          Executed commands:
            - sudo -n arcconf GETCONFIG 1 LD
            - sudo -n arcconf GETCONFIG 1 PD

              The module uses arcconf, which can only be executed by root. It uses sudo and assumes that it is configured such that the netdata user can execute arcconf as root without a password.
              
              Add to your /etc/sudoers file:
              which arcconf shows the full path to the binary.
              
              ```bash
              netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/arcconf
              ```
          - title: Reset Netdata's systemd unit CapabilityBoundingSet (Linux distributions with systemd)
            description: |
              The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using sudo, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute arcconf using sudo.
              
              As root user, do the following:
              
              ```bash
              mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
              echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
              systemctl daemon-reload
              systemctl restart netdata.service
              ```

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
