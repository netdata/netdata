          It uses Puppet's metrics API endpoint to gather the metrics.

            This particular collector does not need further configuration to work if permissions are satisfied, but you can always customize it's data collection behavior.
            
            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
            
            > Notes:
            > - Exact Fully Qualified Domain Name of the node should be used.
            > - Usually Puppet Server/DB startup time is VERY long. So, there should be quite reasonable retry count.
            > - A secured PuppetDB config may require a client certificate. This does not apply to the default PuppetDB configuration though.
