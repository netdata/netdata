      description: |
        This particular collector does not need further configuration to work if permissions are satisfied, but you can always customize it's data collection behavior.

        There are 2 sections:

        * Global variables
        * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

        The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

        Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

        Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.

        > Notes:
        > - Exact Fully Qualified Domain Name of the node should be used.
        > - Usually Puppet Server/DB startup time is VERY long. So, there should be quite reasonable retry count.
        > - A secured PuppetDB config may require a client certificate. This does not apply to the default PuppetDB configuration though.
