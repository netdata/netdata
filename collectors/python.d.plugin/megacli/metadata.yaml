              The module uses megacli, which can only be executed by root. It uses sudo and assumes that it is configured such that the netdata user can execute megacli as root without a password.
              
              Add to your /etc/sudoers file:
              which megacli shows the full path to the binary.
              
              ```bash
              netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/megacli

            description: |
              The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using sudo, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute arcconf using sudo.
              
              As root user, do the following:
              
              ```bash
              mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
              echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
              systemctl daemon-reload

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
