# MegaCLI

Plugin: python.d.plugin
Module: megacli

## Overview

Examine MegaCLI metrics with Netdata for insights into RAID controller performance. Improve your RAID controller efficiency with real-time MegaCLI metrics.

Collects adapter, physical drives and battery stats using megacli command-line tool

Executed commands:

sudo -n megacli -LDPDInfo -aAll
sudo -n megacli -AdpBbuCmd -a0


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.

The module uses megacli, which can only be executed by root. It uses sudo and assumes that it is configured such that the netdata user can execute megacli as root without a password.

### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

After all the permissions are satisfied, netdata should be to execute commands via the megacli command line utility

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per MegaCLI instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| megacli.adapter_degraded | a dimension per adapter | is degraded |
| megacli.pd_media_error | a dimension per physical drive | errors/s |
| megacli.pd_predictive_failure | a dimension per physical drive | failures/s |

### Per battery

Metrics related to Battery Backup Units, each BBU provides its own set of the following metrics.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| megacli.bbu_relative_charge | adapter {battery id} | percentage |
| megacli.bbu_cycle_count | adapter {battery id} | cycle count |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| [ megacli_adapter_state ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/megacli.conf) | megacli.adapter_degraded | adapter is in the degraded state (0: false, 1: true) |
| [ megacli_pd_media_errors ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/megacli.conf) | megacli.pd_media_error | number of physical drive media errors |
| [ megacli_pd_predictive_failures ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/megacli.conf) | megacli.pd_predictive_failure | number of physical drive predictive failures |
| [ megacli_bbu_relative_charge ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/megacli.conf) | megacli.bbu_relative_charge | average battery backup unit (BBU) relative state of charge over the last 10 seconds |
| [ megacli_bbu_cycle_count ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/megacli.conf) | megacli.bbu_cycle_count | average battery backup unit (BBU) charge cycles count over the last 10 seconds |


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Grant permissions for netdata, to run megacli as sudoer

The module uses megacli, which can only be executed by root. It uses sudo and assumes that it is configured such that the netdata user can execute megacli as root without a password.

Add to your /etc/sudoers file:
which megacli shows the full path to the binary.

```bash
netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/megacli
```


#### Reset Netdata's systemd unit CapabilityBoundingSet (Linux distributions with systemd)

The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using sudo, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute arcconf using sudo.

As root user, do the following:

```bash
mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart netdata.service
```



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `python.d/megacli.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config python.d/megacli.conf
```
#### Options

There are 2 sections:

* Global variables
* One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Sets the default data collection frequency. |  | False |
| priority | Controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard. |  | False |
| autodetection_retry | Sets the job re-check interval in seconds. |  | False |
| penalty | Indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures. |  | False |
| do_battery | default is no. Battery stats (adds additional call to megacli `megacli -AdpBbuCmd -a0`). |  | False |

</details>

#### Examples

##### Basic

A basic example configuration per job

```yaml
job_name:
    name: myname
    update_every: 1
    priority: 60000
    penalty: yes
    autodetection_retry: 0

```


## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `megacli` collector, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `python.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./python.d.plugin megacli debug trace
  ```
