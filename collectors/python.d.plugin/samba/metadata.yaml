            description: |
              To run the collector you need:
              
              - `smbstatus` program
              - `sudo` program
              - `smbd` must be compiled with profiling enabled
              - `smbd` must be started either with the `-P 1` option or inside `smb.conf` using `smbd profiling level`
              
              The module uses `smbstatus`, which can only be executed by `root`. It uses `sudo` and assumes that it is configured such that the `netdata` user can execute `smbstatus` as root without a password.
              
              - add to your `/etc/sudoers` file:
              
                `which smbstatus` shows the full path to the binary.
              
                ```bash
                netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/smbstatus
                ```
              
              - Reset Netdata's systemd unit [CapabilityBoundingSet](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Capabilities) (Linux distributions with systemd)
              
                The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using `sudo`, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute `smbstatus` using `sudo`.
              
              
                As the `root` user, do the following:
              
                ```cmd
                mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
                echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
                systemctl daemon-reload
                systemctl restart netdata.service

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
