# Samba

Plugin: python.d.plugin
Module: samba

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors the performance metrics of Samba file sharing.

It is using the `smbstatus` command-line tool.

Executed commands:

- `sudo -n smbstatus -P`


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.

`smbstatus` is used, which can only be executed by `root`. It uses `sudo` and assumes that it is configured such that the `netdata` user can execute `smbstatus` as root without a password.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

After all the permissions are satisfied, the `smbstatus -P` binary is executed.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Samba instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| syscall.rw | sendfile, recvfile | KiB/s |
| smb2.rw | readout, writein, readin, writeout | KiB/s |
| smb2.create_close | create, close | operations/s |
| smb2.get_set_info | getinfo, setinfo | operations/s |
| smb2.find | find | operations/s |
| smb2.notify | notify | operations/s |
| smb2.sm_counters | tcon, negprot, tdis, cancel, logoff, flush, lock, keepalive, break, sessetup | count |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Enable the samba collector

The `samba` collector is disabled by default. To enable it, use `edit-config` from the Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`, to edit the `python.d.conf` file.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config python.d.conf
```
Change the value of the `samba` setting to `yes`. Save the file and restart the Netdata Agent with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate method](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/start-stop-restart.md) for your system.


#### Permissions and programs

To run the collector you need:

- `smbstatus` program
- `sudo` program
- `smbd` must be compiled with profiling enabled
- `smbd` must be started either with the `-P 1` option or inside `smb.conf` using `smbd profiling level`

The module uses `smbstatus`, which can only be executed by `root`. It uses `sudo` and assumes that it is configured such that the `netdata` user can execute `smbstatus` as root without a password.

- add to your `/etc/sudoers` file:

  `which smbstatus` shows the full path to the binary.

  ```bash
  netdata ALL=(root)       NOPASSWD: /path/to/smbstatus
  ```

- Reset Netdata's systemd unit [CapabilityBoundingSet](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.exec.html#Capabilities) (Linux distributions with systemd)

  The default CapabilityBoundingSet doesn't allow using `sudo`, and is quite strict in general. Resetting is not optimal, but a next-best solution given the inability to execute `smbstatus` using `sudo`.


  As the `root` user, do the following:

  ```cmd
  mkdir /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d
  echo -e '[Service]\nCapabilityBoundingSet=~' | tee /etc/systemd/system/netdata.service.d/unset-capability-bounding-set.conf
  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl restart netdata.service
  ```



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `python.d/samba.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config python.d/samba.conf
```
#### Options

There are 2 sections:

* Global variables
* One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Sets the default data collection frequency. |  | False |
| priority | Controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard. |  | False |
| autodetection_retry | Sets the job re-check interval in seconds. |  | False |
| penalty | Indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures. |  | False |

</details>

#### Examples

##### Basic

A basic example configuration.

<details><summary>Config</summary>

```yaml
my_job_name:
  name: my_name
  update_every: 1

```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `samba` collector, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `python.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./python.d.plugin samba debug trace
  ```
