          This collector creates an 'Alarms' menu with one line plot of `alarms.status`.
        method_description: |
          Alarm status is read from the Netdata agent rest api [`/api/v1/alarms?all`](https://learn.netdata.cloud/api#/alerts/alerts1).

            It discovers instances of Netdata running on localhost, and gathers metrics from `http://127.0.0.1:19999/api/v1/alarms?all`. `CLEAR` status is mapped to `0`, `WARNING` to `1` and `CRITICAL` to `2`. Also, by default all alarms produced will be monitored.

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
