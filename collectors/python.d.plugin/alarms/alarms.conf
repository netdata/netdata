# netdata python.d.plugin configuration for example
#
# This file is in YaML format. Generally the format is:
#
# name: value
#
# There are 2 sections:
#  - global variables
#  - one or more JOBS
#
# JOBS allow you to collect values from multiple sources.
# Each source will have its own set of charts.
#
# JOB parameters have to be indented (using spaces only, example below).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Variables
# These variables set the defaults for all JOBs, however each JOB
# may define its own, overriding the defaults.

# update_every sets the default data collection frequency.
# If unset, the python.d.plugin default is used.
# update_every: 10

# priority controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard.
# Lower numbers move the charts towards the top of the page.
# If unset, the default for python.d.plugin is used.
# priority: 60000

# penalty indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures.
# Penalty will increase every 5 failed updates in a row. Maximum penalty is 10 minutes.
# penalty: yes

# autodetection_retry sets the job re-check interval in seconds.
# The job is not deleted if check fails.
# Attempts to start the job are made once every autodetection_retry.
# This feature is disabled by default.
# autodetection_retry: 0

# what url to pull data from
local:
  url: 'http://127.0.0.1:19999/api/v1/alarms?all'
  # define how to map alarm status to numbers for the chart
  status_map:
    CLEAR: 0
    WARNING: 1
    CRITICAL: 2
  # set to true to include a chart with calculated alarm values over time
  collect_alarm_values: false
  # define the type of chart for plotting status over time e.g. 'line' or 'stacked'
  alarm_status_chart_type: 'line'
