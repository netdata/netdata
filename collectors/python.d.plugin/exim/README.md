# Exim monitoring with Netdata

Simple module executing `exim -bpc` to grab exim queue.
This command can take a lot of time to finish its execution thus it is not recommended to run it every second.

## Requirements

The module uses the `exim` binary, which can only be executed as root by default. We need to allow other users to `exim` binary. We solve that adding `queue_list_requires_admin` statement in exim configuration and set to `false`, because it is `true` by default. On many Linux distributions, the default location of `exim` configuration is in `/etc/exim.conf`.

1. Edit the `exim` configuration with your preferred editor and add:
`queue_list_requires_admin = false`
2. Restart `exim` and Netdata

*WHM (CPanel) server*

On a WHM server, you can reconfigure `exim` over the WHM interface with the following steps.

1. Login to WHM
2. Navigate to Service Configuration --> Exim Configuration Manager --> tab Advanced Editor
3. Scroll down to the button **Add additional configuration setting** and click on it.
4. In the new dropdown which will appear above we need to find and choose:
`queue_list_requires_admin` and set to `false` 
5. Scroll to the end and click the **Save** button.

It produces only one chart:

1.  **Exim Queue Emails**

    -   emails

Configuration is not needed.
