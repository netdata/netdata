              The module uses the `exim` binary, which can only be executed as root by default. We need to allow other users to `exim` binary. We solve that adding `queue_list_requires_admin` statement in exim configuration and set to `false`, because it is `true` by default. On many Linux distributions, the default location of `exim` configuration is in `/etc/exim.conf`.
              
              1. Edit the `exim` configuration with your preferred editor and add:
              `queue_list_requires_admin = false`
              2. Restart `exim` and Netdata

              On a WHM server, you can reconfigure `exim` over the WHM interface with the following steps.
              
              1. Login to WHM
              2. Navigate to Service Configuration --> Exim Configuration Manager --> tab Advanced Editor
              3. Scroll down to the button **Add additional configuration setting** and click on it.
              4. In the new dropdown which will appear above we need to find and choose:
              `queue_list_requires_admin` and set to `false`
              5. Scroll to the end and click the **Save** button.

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
