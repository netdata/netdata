          Monitor Fail2ban performance for prime intrusion prevention operations. Monitor ban counts, jail statuses, and failed login attempts to ensure robust network security.

          It collects metrics through reading the default log and configuration files of fail2ban.

        description: |
          The `fail2ban.log` file must be readable by the user `netdata`.
            - change the file ownership and access permissions.
            - update `/etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban`` to persist the changes after rotating the log file.
          
          To change the file ownership and access permissions, execute the following:
          
          ```shell
          sudo chown root:netdata /var/log/fail2ban.log
          sudo chmod 640 /var/log/fail2ban.log
          ```
          
          To persist the changes after rotating the log file, add `create 640 root netdata` to the `/etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban`:
          
          ```shell
          /var/log/fail2ban.log {
          
              weekly
              rotate 4
              compress
          
              delaycompress
              missingok
              postrotate
                  fail2ban-client flushlogs 1>/dev/null
              endscript
          
              # If fail2ban runs as non-root it still needs to have write access
              # to logfiles.
              # create 640 fail2ban adm
              create 640 root netdata
          }

            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
