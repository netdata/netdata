        description: |
          The `fail2ban.log` file must be readable by the user `netdata`.
            - change the file ownership and access permissions.
            - update `/etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban`` to persist the changes after rotating the log file.

          To change the file ownership and access permissions, execute the following:

          ```shell
          sudo chown root:netdata /var/log/fail2ban.log
          sudo chmod 640 /var/log/fail2ban.log
          ```

          To persist the changes after rotating the log file, add `create 640 root netdata` to the `/etc/logrotate.d/fail2ban`:

          ```shell
          /var/log/fail2ban.log {

              weekly
              rotate 4
              compress

              delaycompress
              missingok
              postrotate
                  fail2ban-client flushlogs 1>/dev/null
              endscript

              # If fail2ban runs as non-root it still needs to have write access
              # to logfiles.
              # create 640 fail2ban adm
              create 640 root netdata
          }

            There are 2 sections:

            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.

            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.

            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.

            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.

              To troubleshoot issues with the `fail2ban` module, run the `python.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled.
              The output will give you the output of the data collection job or error messages on why the collector isn't working.

              First, navigate to your plugins directory, usually they are located under `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's
              not the case on your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the
              plugin's directory, switch to the `netdata` user.

              ```bash
              cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
              sudo su -s /bin/bash netdata
              ```

              Now you can manually run the `fail2ban` module in debug mode:

              ```bash
              ./python.d.plugin fail2ban debug trace
              ```
