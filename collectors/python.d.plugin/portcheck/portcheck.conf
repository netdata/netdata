# netdata python.d.plugin configuration for portcheck
#
# This file is in YaML format. Generally the format is:
#
# name: value
#
# There are 2 sections:
#  - global variables
#  - one or more JOBS
#
# JOBS allow you to collect values from multiple sources.
# Each source will have its own set of charts.
#
# JOB parameters have to be indented (using spaces only, example below).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Variables
# These variables set the defaults for all JOBs, however each JOB
# may define its own, overriding the defaults.

# update_every sets the default data collection frequency.
# If unset, the python.d.plugin default is used.
# update_every: 1

# priority controls the order of charts at the netdata dashboard.
# Lower numbers move the charts towards the top of the page.
# If unset, the default for python.d.plugin is used.
# priority: 60000

# penalty indicates whether to apply penalty to update_every in case of failures.
# Penalty will increase every 5 failed updates in a row. Maximum penalty is 10 minutes.
# penalty: yes

# chart_cleanup sets the default chart cleanup interval in iterations.
# A chart is marked as obsolete if it has not been updated
# 'chart_cleanup' iterations in a row.
# They will be hidden immediately (not offered to dashboard viewer,
# streamed upstream and archived to backends) and deleted one hour
# later (configurable from netdata.conf).
# -- For this plugin, cleanup MUST be disabled, otherwise we lose latency chart
chart_cleanup: 0

# Autodetection and retries do not work for this plugin

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# JOBS (data collection sources)
#
# The default JOBS share the same *name*. JOBS with the same name
# are mutually exclusive. Only one of them will be allowed running at
# any time. This allows autodetection to try several alternatives and
# pick the one that works.
#
# Any number of jobs is supported.
#
# -------------------------------
# ATTENTION: Any valid configuration will be accepted, even if initial connection fails!
# -------------------------------
#
# There is intentionally no default config for 'localhost'

# job_name:
#     name: myname            # [optional] the JOB's name as it will appear at the
#                             # dashboard (by default is the job_name)
#                             # JOBs sharing a name are mutually exclusive
#     update_every: 1         # [optional] the JOB's data collection frequency
#     priority: 60000         # [optional] the JOB's order on the dashboard
#     penalty: yes            # the JOB's penalty
#     timeout: 1              # [optional] the socket timeout when connecting
#     host: 'dns or ip'       # [required] the remote host address in either IPv4, IPv6 or as DNS name.
#     port: 22                # [required] the port number to check. Specify an integer, not service name.

# You just have been warned about possible portscan blocking. The portcheck plugin is meant for simple use cases.
# Currently, the accuracy of the latency is low and should be used as reference only.
