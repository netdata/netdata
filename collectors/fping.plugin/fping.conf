# The time in milliseconds (1 sec = 1000 ms) to ping the hosts

# other fping options - defaults:
# -R      = send packets with random data
# -b 56   = the number of bytes per packet
# -i 1    = 1 ms when sending packets to others hosts (switching hosts)
# -r 0    = never retry packets
# -t 5000 = per packet timeout at 5000 ms
