# getifaddrs

Plugin: freebsd.plugin
Module: getifaddrs

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

Collect traffic per network interface.

The plugin calls `getifaddrs` function to collect necessary data.

This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per getifaddrs instance

General overview about network traffic.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| system.net | received, sent | kilobits/s |
| system.packets | received, sent, multicast_received, multicast_sent | packets/s |
| system.ipv4 | received, sent | kilobits/s |
| system.ipv6 | received, sent | kilobits/s |

### Per network device



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| net.net | received, sent | kilobits/s |
| net.packets | received, sent, multicast_received, multicast_sent | packets/s |
| net.errors | inbound, outbound | errors/s |
| net.drops | inbound, outbound | drops/s |
| net.events | collisions | events/s |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|

| [ 1m_sent_traffic_overflow ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/net.conf) | net.net | average outbound utilization for the network interface ${label:device} over the last minute |
| [ inbound_packets_dropped_ratio ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/net.conf) | net.packets | ratio of inbound dropped packets for the network interface ${label:device} over the last 10 minutes |
| [ outbound_packets_dropped_ratio ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/net.conf) | net.packets | ratio of outbound dropped packets for the network interface ${label:device} over the last 10 minutes |

| [ outbound_packets_dropped ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/health.d/net.conf) | net.drops | number of outbound dropped packets for the network interface ${label:device} in the last 10 minutes |


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `netdata.conf`.
Configuration for this specific integration is located in the `[plugin:freebsd:getifaddrs]` section within that file.

The file format is a modified INI syntax. The general structure is:

```toml
[section1]
    option 1 = some value
    option 2 = some other value

[section2]
    option 3 = some third value
```
You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
```
