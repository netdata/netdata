INJECTED=Key INJECTED had value 'value01 - value02' and now has this, but only on the first row of the log.
KEY1=value01
KEY2=value02
KEY3=value03
KEY4=value04
SIMPLE_INJECTION=An unset variable looks like '', while the value of KEY2 is 'value02'
YET_ANOTHER_INJECTION=value01 - value02 - Key INJECTED had value 'value01 - value02' and now has this, but only on the first row of the log. - this should work because inject is yes

INJECTED=value11 - value12
KEY1=value11

YET_ANOTHER_INJECTION=value11 - value12 - value11 - value12 - this should work because inject is yes

INJECTED=KEY4 has the value 'value24'; it is not empty, so INJECTED has been rewritten.
