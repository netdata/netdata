# AI-Powered Alert Troubleshooting

## Overview

When an alert fires, you can use AI to generate a detailed troubleshooting report that analyzes whether the alert requires immediate action or is just noise. The AI examines your alert's history, correlates it with thousands of other metrics across your infrastructure, and provides actionable insightsâ€”all within minutes.

### Key Benefits

- **Save hours of manual investigation** - Skip the initial data collection and correlation work
- **Reduce alert fatigue** - Quickly identify false positives versus legitimate issues
- **Get actionable guidance** - Receive specific next steps based on the analysis
- **Start from insight, not zero** - Begin troubleshooting with a comprehensive baseline analysis

### How It Works

The AI troubleshooting engine performs three key analyses when you trigger an investigation:

1. **Alert Analysis** - Examines the alert's history and underlying metric behavior to determine if it's a transient false positive or legitimate issue
2. **Correlation Discovery** - Scans thousands of metrics and log patterns across your infrastructure to identify what else was behaving abnormally at the same time
3. **Root Cause Hypothesis** - Provides a summary of findings and suggests likely root causes, pointing you to the most relevant metrics or dimensions

### Starting an Alert Investigation

You can trigger AI troubleshooting in three ways:

#### From the Alerts Tab

Click the **"Ask AI"** button next to any active or recent alert.
