# Troubleshooting

Netdata AI accelerates troubleshooting with three complementary tools:

- Alert Troubleshooting: one‑click analysis from any alert
- Anomaly Advisor: interactive, ML‑driven incident investigation
- Metric Correlations: quickly focus on relevant charts for a time window

Use Alert Troubleshooting to start from an alert with an automated baseline. Pivot to Anomaly Advisor for propagation analysis and to Metric Correlations to narrow the search space across charts.

## Alert Troubleshooting

Generate a report that assesses alert validity, uncovers correlated signals, and proposes a root‑cause hypothesis with supporting evidence. Start from the Alerts tab (`Ask AI`), Insights (`Alert Troubleshooting`), or the link in alert emails.

## Anomaly Advisor

Explore incident timelines visually and see how anomalies cascade across your infrastructure. Start from the Anomalies tab in Netdata Cloud.

## Metric Correlations

From any dashboard or time window, surface the charts most related to your selection to speed root cause analysis.
