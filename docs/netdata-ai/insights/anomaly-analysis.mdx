# Anomaly Analysis

Get a forensics‑grade explanation of unusual behavior. The Anomaly Analysis report correlates ML‑detected anomalies across nodes and metrics, reconstructs the timeline, and proposes likely root causes with supporting evidence.

## When to use it

- Post‑incident analysis and RCA preparation
- Investigating “what changed here?” on a chart or service
- Validating whether anomalies were symptoms or causes

## How to generate

1. In Netdata Cloud, open `Insights`
2. Select `Anomaly Analysis`
3. Choose the time window around the event of interest
4. Scope to affected services/nodes if known
5. Click `Generate`

## What’s analyzed

- Agent‑side ML anomaly scores (every metric, every second)
- Temporal propagation of anomalies across metrics/services
- Correlations with alerts, deployments, and configuration changes
- Cross‑node relationships and influence chains

## What you get

- Narrative of how the incident unfolded
- Ranked list of likely root causes vs. downstream effects
- Key correlated signals and “why this matters” notes
- Recommendations to prevent recurrence

## Example: “What changed here?”

Point the report at a suspicious time window and let it reconstruct the change: which metrics shifted first, where anomalies clustered, and which changes correlate strongly with the observed behavior.
