# Scheduled Reports

Automate your reporting workflow. Scheduled AI reports let you run Insights and Investigations on a recurring cadence and deliver the results automatically—turning manual, repetitive work into a hands‑off process.

## What you can schedule

- Any pre‑built Insight: Infrastructure Summary, Performance Optimization, Capacity Planning, Anomaly Analysis
- Custom Investigations (your own prompts and scope)

## How to schedule a report

1. Go to the `Insights` tab in Netdata Cloud
2. Pick an Insight type or click `New Investigation`
3. Configure the time range and scope
4. Click `Schedule` (next to `Generate`)
5. Choose cadence (daily/weekly/monthly) and time

At the scheduled time, Netdata AI runs the report and delivers it to your email and the Insights tab.
