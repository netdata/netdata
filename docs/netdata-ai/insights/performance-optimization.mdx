# Performance Optimization

Find bottlenecks before users notice. The Performance Optimization report analyzes contention patterns, throttling risks, and systemic inefficiencies, then produces prioritized, concrete remediation steps tied to your observed workload.

## When to use it

- Ongoing SRE/ops optimization workstreams
- After key deploys, major configuration changes, or scaling events
- To prepare proposals for performance investments or capacity changes

## How to generate

1. Open the `Insights` tab in Netdata Cloud
2. Select `Performance Optimization`
3. Choose a window (e.g., last 24h, 7d, 30d, or custom)
4. Scope to infrastructure segments (rooms/spaces) or services of interest
5. Click `Generate`

## What’s analyzed

- CPU and memory saturation, noisy neighbors, and throttling signals
- Disk IO, queue depths, saturation ratios, filesystem pressure
- Network throughput, packet loss, retransmits, egress hot spots
- Container and pod throttling, OOM risks, scheduling pressure
- Database/service bottlenecks and backpressure evidence

## What you get

- Ranked list of bottlenecks with severity and confidence
- Correlated signals to distinguish cause vs. symptom
- Specific tuning and right‑sizing recommendations
- Expected impact estimates where feasible (latency/throughput)
- Before/after projections for planned changes (when applicable)

## Example: Debugging Kubernetes performance

An SRE investigating cluster slowness sees synthesized findings about container throttling, resource contention on specific nodes, and recommended limit/request adjustments—with nodes and workloads called out explicitly.

## Best practices

- Run monthly for baselining; run ad‑hoc after notable changes
- Use findings to drive tickets with clear owners and measurable goals
- Combine with `Capacity Planning` for a balanced performance/cost view

## Availability and usage

- Available on Business and Free Trial plans
- Each report consumes 1 AI credit (10 free per month on eligible plans)
- Results are saved in Insights and downloadable as PDFs
