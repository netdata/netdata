# Installation reference

Netdata offers many installation methods to support all your physical/virtual servers.

The **recommended** way to install Netdata on a Linux node (physical, virtual, container, IoT) is our [one-line
installer script (`kickstart.sh`)](/docs/get-started.mdx#install-on-linux-with-one-line-installer-recommended), which
automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata from its source code. For those who don't want to install Netdata
directly, we also recommend [running Netdata with Docker](/docs/get-started.mdx#run-netdata-with-docker).

## Supported operating systems

We run automated checks on every PR to ensure that Netdata installs and runs properly on the following Linux
distributions:

- Ubuntu `21.04`, `20.10`, `20.04`, `18.04`, `16.04`
- Debian `10`, `9`
- Alpine `edge`, `3.13`, `3.12`, `3.11`, `3.10`
- Arch Linux `latest`
- Fedora `34`, `33`, `32`
- CentOS `8`, `7`
- OpenSUSE `tumbleweed:latest`, `leap:15.2`
- Clear Linux `latest`

Netdata runs on other distributions and operating systems as well, but they aren't officially supported by our team.

## `netdata-installer.sh`

The following installation methods are based around
[`netdata-installer.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata/master/netdata-installer.sh), which handles
the installation process itself:

- [One-line installer (`kickstart.sh`)](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md)
- [Manual from Git](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md)
- [Build from source](/packaging/installer/methods/source.md)
- [Offline nodes](/packaging/installer/methods/offline.md)

`netdata-installer.sh` is, essentially, an automated version of the [manual from
Git](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md) method.

Both the [pre-compiled static binary (`kickstart-static64.sh`)](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart64.md) and
[Docker](/packaging/installer/docker/README.md) installation methods use bundles that are _built_ using
`netdata-installer.sh`, but none of the code is run on your system.

### Parameters

The [`netdata-install.sh` script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata/master/netdata-installer.sh) takes
the following parameters to customize any installation of Netdata.

| Parameter                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--install PATH`                                      | Install Netdata in `PATH`. For example, `--install /opt` will put Netdata in `/opt/netdata`.                                                                                        |
| `--reinstall`                                         | If an existing install is detected, reinstall instead of trying to update it. See the [reinstall](/docs/installation/reinstall.mdx) doc for details.                                |
| `--dont-start-it`                                     | Prevent the installer from starting Netdata automatically.                                                                                                                          |
| `--dont-wait`                                         | Run in non-interactive mode to skip prompting for permission to install any required packages. Useful for automated installation, such as with [Ansible](/docs/guides/ansible.md).  |
| `--auto-update` or `-u`                               | Install `netdata-update`r in cron to update Netdata automatically once per day.                                                                                                     |
| `--auto-update-type`                                  | Override the auto-update scheduling mechanism detection. Currently supported types are: `systemd`, `interval`, `crontab`.                                                           |
| `--no-updates`                                        | Prevent automatic updates of any kind.                                                                                                                                              |
| `--stable-channel`                                    | Automatically update only on the release of new major versions. See [nightly vs. stable releases](#nightly-vs-stable-releases).                                                     |
| `--nightly-channel`                                   | Automatically update on every new nightly build. See [nightly vs. stable releases](#nightly-vs-stable-releases).                                                                    |
| `--local-files`                                       | Used for [offline installations](offline.md). This option conflicts with the `--stable-channel` option. If you set this _and_ `--stable-channel`, Netdata will use the local files. |
| `--disable-telemetry`                                 | Opt-out of [anonymous statistics](/docs/anonymous-statistics.md) we use to make Netdata better. Sets `DO_NOT_TRACK` to `1`.                                                         |
| `--disable-go`                                        | Disable installation of go.d.plugin. Default: `enabled`.                                                                                                                            |
| `--disable-ebpf`                                      | Disable eBPF Kernel plugin. Default: `enabled`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `--disable-cloud`                                     | Disable all [Netdata Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud) functionality.                                                                                                  |
| `--require-cloud`                                     | Fail the install if it can't build Netdata Cloud support.                                                                                                                           |

## Automatic updates

By default, Netdata's installation scripts enable automatic updates for both nightly and stable release channels.

If you would prefer to [update Netdata manually](/packaging/installer/UPDATE.md), you can disable automatic updates by
using the `--no-updates` option when you install or update Netdata.

```bash
bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --no-updates
```

### Network usage of Netdata’s automatic updater

The auto-update functionality set up by the installation scripts requires working internet access to function
correctly. In particular, it currently requires access to GitHub (to check if a newer version of the updater script
is available or not, as well as potentially fetching build-time dependencies that are bundled as part of the install),
and Google Cloud Storage (to check for newer versions of Netdata and download the sources if there is a newer version).

Note that the auto-update functionality will check for updates to itself independently of updates to Netdata,
and will try to use the latest version of the updater script whenever possible. This is intended to reduce the
amount of effort required by users to get updates working again in the event of a bug in the updater code.

## Nightly vs. stable releases

The Netdata team maintains two releases of the Netdata agent: **nightly** and **stable**. By default, Netdata's
installation scripts will give you **automatic, nightly** updates, as that is our recommended configuration.

**Nightly**: We create nightly builds every 24 hours. They contain fully-tested code that fixes bugs or security flaws,
or introduces new features to Netdata. Every nightly release is a candidate for then becoming a stable release—when
we're ready, we simply change the release tags on GitHub. That means nightly releases are stable and proven to function
correctly in the vast majority of Netdata use cases. That's why nightly is the _best choice for most Netdata users_.

**Stable**: We create stable releases whenever we believe the code has reached a major milestone. Most often, stable
releases correlate with the introduction of new, significant features. Stable releases might be a better choice for
those who run Netdata in _mission-critical production systems_, as updates will come more infrequently, and only after
the community helps fix any bugs that might have been introduced in previous releases.

**Pros of using nightly releases:**

-   Get the latest features and bug fixes as soon as they're available
-   Receive security-related fixes immediately
-   Use stable, fully-tested code that's always improving
-   Leverage the same Netdata experience our community is using

**Pros of using stable releases:**

-   Protect yourself from the rare instance when major bugs slip through our testing and negatively affect a Netdata
    installation
-   Retain more control over the Netdata version you use

## Troubleshooting and known issues

We are tracking a few issues related to installation and packaging.

### Older distributions (Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 8, CentOS 6) and OpenSSL

If you're running an older Linux distribution or one that has reached EOL, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian 8, or CentOS
6, your Agent may not be able to securely connect to Netdata Cloud due to an outdated version of OpenSSL. These old
versions of OpenSSL cannot perform [hostname validation](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Hostname_validation), which
helps securely encrypt SSL connections.

We recommend you reinstall Netdata with a [static build](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart-64.md), which uses an
up-to-date version of OpenSSL with hostname validation enabled.

If you choose to continue using the outdated version of OpenSSL, your node will still connect to Netdata Cloud, albeit
with hostname verification disabled. Without verification, your Netdata Cloud connection could be vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks.

### CentOS 6 and CentOS 8

To install the Agent on certain CentOS and RHEL systems, you must enable non-default repositories, such as EPEL or
PowerTools, to gather hard dependencies. See the [CentOS 6](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md#centos-rehel-6-x) and
[CentOS 8](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md#centos-rehel-8-x) sections for more information.

### Access to file is not permitted

If you see an error similar to `Access to file is not permitted: /usr/share/netdata/web//index.html` when you try to
visit the Agent dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, you need to update Netdata's permissions to match those of your
system.

Run `ls -la /usr/share/netdata/web/index.html` to find the file's permissions. You may need to change this path based on
the error you're seeing in your browser. In the below example, the file is owned by the user `netdata` and the group
`netdata`.

```bash
ls -la /usr/share/netdata/web/index.html
-rw-r--r--. 1 netdata netdata 89377 May  5 06:30 /usr/share/netdata/web/index.html
```

Open your `netdata.conf` file and find the `[web]` section, plus the `web files owner`/`web files group` settings. Edit
the lines to match the output from `ls -la` above and uncomment them if necessary.

```conf
[web]
    web files owner = netdata
    web files group = netdata
```

Save the file, restart Netdata using `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate
method](/docs/configure/start-stop-restart.md) for your system, and try accessing the dashboard again.

### Multiple versions of OpenSSL

We've received reports from the community about issues with running the `kickstart.sh` script on systems that have both
a distribution-installed version of OpenSSL and a manually-installed local version. The Agent's installer cannot handle
both.

We recommend you install Netdata with the [static binary](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart-64.md) to avoid the
issue altogether. Or, you can manually remove one version of OpenSSL to remove the conflict.

### Clang compiler on Linux

Our current build process has some issues when using certain configurations of the `clang` C compiler on Linux. See [the
section on `nonrepresentable section on output`
errors](/packaging/installer/methods/manual.md#nonrepresentable-section-on-output-errors) for a workaround.
