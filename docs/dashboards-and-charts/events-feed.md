# Events tab

The Events tab provides a feed which is a powerful feature that tracks events that happen on your infrastructure, or in your Space. The feed lets you investigate events that occurred in the past, which is invaluable for troubleshooting. Common use cases are ones like when a node goes offline, and you want to understand what events happened before that. A detailed event history can also assist in attributing sudden pattern changes in a time series to specific changes in your environment.

## What are the available events?

At a high-level view, these are the domains from which the Events feed will provide visibility into.

> **Note**
>
> Based on your space's plan, different allowances are defined to query past data.

| Node Removed        | The node was removed from the Space, for example by using the `Delete` action on the node. This is a soft delete in that the node gets marked as deleted, but retains the association with this space. If it becomes live again, it will be restored (see `Node Restored` below) and reappear in this space as before. | Node `ip-xyz.ec2.internal` was **deleted (soft)**                                                               |

## Who can access the events?

All users will be able to see events from the Topology and Alerts domain but Auditing events, once these are added, will only be accessible to administrators. For more details check the [Netdata Role-Based Access model](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-cloud/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-model.md).

## How to use the events feed

1. Click on the **Events** tab (located near the top of your screen)
1. You will be presented with a table listing the events that occurred from the timeframe defined on the [date time picker](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboards-and-charts/visualization-date-and-time-controls.md#date-and-time-selector)
1. You can use the filtering capabilities available on right-hand bar to slice through the results provided. See more details on [event types and filters](#event-types-and-filters)
