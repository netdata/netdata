# Kubernetes tab

The Netdata dashboards feature enhanced visualizations for the resource utilization of Kubernetes (k8s) clusters, embedded in the default [Metrics tab](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboards-and-charts/metrics-tab-and-single-node-tabs.md) dashboard.

These visualizations include a health map for viewing the status of k8s pods/containers, in addition to [Netdata charts](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboards-and-charts/netdata-charts.md) for viewing per-second CPU, memory, disk, and networking metrics from k8s nodes.

See our [Kubernetes deployment instructions](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/packaging/installer/methods/kubernetes.md) for details on deploying Netdata on your Kubernetes cluster.

## Available Kubernetes metrics

Netdata Cloud organizes and visualizes the following metrics from your Kubernetes cluster from every container:

When viewing the [overview of this dashboard](#kubernetes-containers-overview), Netdata presents the above metrics per container, or aggregated based on
their associated pods.

## Kubernetes Containers overview

At the top of the Kubernetes containers section there is a map, that with a given context colorizes the containers in terms of their utilization.

The filtering of this map is controlled by using the [NIDL framework](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboards-and-charts/netdata-charts.md#nidl-framework) from the definition bar of the chart.

### Detailed information

Hover over any of the pods/containers in the map to display a modal window, which contains contextual information and real-time metrics from that resource.
