# Logs tab

The Logs tab is using the [`journal-viewer` plugin](/docs/logs/README.md), to present a structured view into your infrastructure's `systemd` logs.

We have a thorough section explaining how you can [work with logs](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/logs), detailing how the plugin works, and what other utilities are used under the hood to provide you with the visualizations and the log entries.

The [`journal-viewer` plugin](/docs/logs/README.md) documentation has information about:

- [Key features the plugin provides](/docs/logs/README.md#key-features)
- [Journal sources](/docs/logs/README.md#journal-sources)
- [Journal fields](/docs/logs/README.md#journal-fields)
- [Full-text search](/docs/logs/README.md#full-text-search)
- [Query performance](/docs/logs/README.md#query-performance)
- [Performance at scale](/docs/logs/README.md#performance-at-scale)

We recommend you to read through that document, to better understand how the plugin and the visualizations work.
