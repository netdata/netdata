# Netdata MCP Integration: AI-Powered Infrastructure Analysis

## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a new open standard that allows AI assistants to connect directly to your data sources and tools. Think of it as a bridge that lets AI systems access and analyze your real-time infrastructure data instead of just providing generic advice.

:::note

**Learn More**: MCP is an open standard created by Anthropic. For technical details about the protocol specification, visit [Anthropic's MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## How Netdata is Pioneering AI-Powered Monitoring

Netdata is **one of the first monitoring platforms** to integrate MCP, placing us among the pioneers in AI-powered infrastructure analysis. We've built a direct connection between advanced AI models (like Claude) and your Netdata monitoring data, creating an intelligent troubleshooting partner that understands your specific infrastructure.

### What Makes This Revolutionary

**Traditional monitoring**: You look at charts and graphs, manually correlating data across different services to find problems.

**Netdata with MCP**: AI analyzes your actual monitoring data in real-time, automatically correlates anomalies across your entire infrastructure, and provides expert-level post-mortem analysis.

## What This Changes for You

### Instant Expert Analysis

Instead of spending hours analyzing charts during an incident, you can now:

- **Ask natural questions**: "What caused the outage between 13:00-13:30 UTC?"
- **Get comprehensive post-mortems**: AI analyzes your metrics, identifies root causes, and maps dependency chains
- **Understand complex correlations**: AI detects which services were affected and why

### Real-World Example

**The Problem**: EMQX message broker goes down, affecting multiple services across your infrastructure.

### Advanced Anomaly Detection

Your AI assistant can:

- **Detect anomaly patterns** across your entire infrastructure
- **Identify cascade failures** before they become critical
- **Explain complex service dependencies** in plain language
- **Predict which services will be affected** by specific component failures

### How to Get Started

1. **Install Netdata nightly build** (required for MCP support)
2. **Set up the MCP bridge** using our nd-mcp tool
3. **Connect your AI assistant** (Claude Desktop recommended)
4. **Start asking questions** about your infrastructure

:::note

**Current Version**: MCP integration works with both individual Netdata agents and parent agents that aggregate data from multiple nodes. When connected to a parent, AI can analyze data across all nodes that stream to that parent.

## What's Coming Next

### Netdata Cloud Integration

**The next major step**: MCP will integrate directly with Netdata Cloud, giving you access to your complete infrastructure data:

- **Organization-wide analysis** across all your monitored infrastructure
- **Cross-room correlation** for complex distributed systems
- **Complete infrastructure visibility** through AI analysis
- **Team-wide insights** from your centralized monitoring data

### Beyond Single Nodes

**Current capability**: MCP integration works with individual Netdata agents and parent agents that aggregate multiple nodes.

**Coming soon**: Direct access to your Netdata Cloud data, enabling AI analysis across your entire infrastructure ecosystem with full organizational context.

## The Future of Infrastructure Monitoring

With Netdata MCP, we're moving toward a future where:

- **AI understands your infrastructure** as well as your best engineers
- **Troubleshooting becomes conversational** rather than manual chart analysis
- **Post-mortems write themselves** with complete root cause analysis
- **Your monitoring system becomes a team member** that helps solve problems

**Join us in pioneering the next generation of intelligent infrastructure monitoring.**
