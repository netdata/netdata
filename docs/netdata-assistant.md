# Netdata AI: Alert Assistant & Infrastructure Insights

**Netdata AI provides intelligent assistance for both immediate alert response and strategic infrastructure analysis** using advanced AI to help you understand incidents quickly and synthesize high-resolution metrics into actionable intelligence.

This comprehensive system combines **real-time alert assistance** for emergency troubleshooting with **strategic infrastructure insights** for long-term planning, helping you both respond to immediate incidents and make informed decisions about your infrastructure's future.

## Two Complementary Approaches

Netdata Insights serves different moments in your engineering workflow through two distinct but complementary capabilities:

| Aspect               | **Real-time Alert Assistant**     | **Strategic Insights Reports**                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use**      | **Immediate incident response**   | Strategic planning & analysis                                                                    |
| **When You Use It**  | During active alerts              | Post-incident, planning sessions                                                                 |
| **Mindset**          | "The building is on fire"         | "Let's understand and plan better"                                                               |
| **Response Time**    | **Instant contextual help**       | **2-3 minutes for comprehensive analysis**                                                       |
| **Scope**            | Single alert or immediate issue   | Infrastructure-wide trends and patterns                                                          |
| **Output**           | Quick explanations and next steps | Detailed reports with embedded visualizations, **downloadable as PDFs**, **shareable via email** |
| **Typical Scenario** | 3 AM emergency response           | Monday morning incident review                                                                   |

## Strategic Insights Reports

**Generate comprehensive infrastructure analysis** that synthesizes days, weeks, or months of high-resolution data into actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making.

**Insights Reports transform your raw telemetry data into structured narratives** that help you understand trends, plan capacity, optimize performance, and conduct thorough post-incident analysis.

### Four Types of Strategic Analysis

| Report Type                  | What It Provides                                                            | Key Capabilities                                                                                                                                        | Best Used For                                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Infrastructure Summary**   | Complete timeline of incidents, performance changes, and system behavior    | **What happened**: Timeline reconstruction **Impact assessment**: Affected services **Current status**: Action items                                    | Weekend incident recovery, executive updates, team handoffs                 |
| **Capacity Planning**        | Data-driven projections with concrete recommendations                       | **Trend analysis**: Resource utilization patterns **Bottleneck prediction**: Inflection-point dates **Scaling recommendations**: Hardware suggestions   | Quarterly planning, budget justification, infrastructure roadmaps           |
| **Performance Optimization** | Synthesized analysis of system inefficiencies and improvement opportunities | **Contention patterns**: Resource conflicts **Optimization opportunities**: Tuning recommendations **Impact prioritization**: Biggest improvement areas | Performance debugging, system tuning, SRE optimization projects             |
| **Anomaly Analysis**         | Context-aware detection and explanation of unusual infrastructure behavior  | **Pattern recognition**: Abnormal behavior **Root cause analysis**: Why anomalies occurred **Trend correlation**: Cross-infrastructure connections      | Post-incident analysis, proactive issue detection, system health assessment |

**Simply request the analysis you need and get comprehensive reports** that turn months of raw telemetry data into clear, actionable intelligence that helps you make better infrastructure decisions faster.

## How Netdata Insights Works

The system combines three key components to deliver infrastructure intelligence at scale:

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Data Pipeline</strong></summary><br/>

Your Netdata agents continue collecting metrics every second, storing them locally as they always have. **When you request analysis, Insights queries relevant time ranges across your infrastructure**, pulling raw metrics, events, and anomaly detection results.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. Context Compression</strong></summary><br/>

Raw telemetry data is compressed into structured context bundles that include:

- **Statistical summaries** (percentiles, trends, correlation coefficients)
- **Detected anomalies** with confidence scores and affected metrics
- **Event timelines** (alerts, deployments, configuration changes)
- **Cross-node correlations** and dependency mappings
- **Historical baselines** for comparison

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. AI Analysis</strong></summary><br/>

**Advanced language models process the compressed context** to generate structured reports with natural-language explanations, relevant visualizations, and actionable recommendations.

:::important

Your infrastructure data is processed for your reports and then discarded. **We never use them for training or model improvement**.

## What's Coming Next

The goal is building **an autonomous debugging partner, not just another chatbot**. A system that scales human decision-making using all the info that Netdata already collects about your infrastructure.
