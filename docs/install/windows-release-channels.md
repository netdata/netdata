# Switching Netdata Install Types and Release Channels on Windows

You can switch between different Netdata release channels on Windows based on your needs. This guide covers the process with step-by-step instructions.

## Understanding Windows Installation Architecture

Unlike Linux systems where Netdata has multiple install types (native packages, static builds, Docker, etc.), **Windows only has one install type**: the **MSI installer**.

This simplifies the switching process significantly:

- No need to determine your "install type" (it's always MSI)
- No complex switching procedures between different installation methods
- MSI handles upgrades automatically

### Release Channels Available

| Channel     | Download URL                                                                            | Update Frequency         | Recommended For                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Stable**  | `https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/latest/download/netdata-x64.msi`           | Major and patch releases | Production systems, most users                  |
| **Nightly** | `https://github.com/netdata/netdata-nightlies/releases/latest/download/netdata-x64.msi` | Daily builds             | Testing, early adopters, bleeding-edge features |

<details>
<summary>When to Choose Each Channel</summary>

**Choose Stable Channel If:**

- You're running production systems
- You need predictable, well-tested releases
- You prefer less frequent updates (major releases only)
- You want maximum stability over cutting-edge features
- You have strict change management processes

**Choose Nightly Channel If:**

- You're testing new features before production deployment
- You want immediate bug fixes without waiting for releases
- You're contributing to Netdata development and need latest code
- You want to provide early feedback to the Netdata team

**Update Frequency**: Stable releases occur every few weeks to months, while Nightly builds are updated daily with every commit to the master branch.

</details>

## Data Preservation When Switching Channels

When switching between release channels on Windows, the MSI installer automatically preserves your important data and configuration.

**Preserved during channel switches:**

- Configuration files (`netdata.conf`, collector configs) in `C:\Program Files\Netdata\etc\netdata`
- Historical metrics data
- Alert configurations
- Cloud connection settings (claim token, room assignments)

**Not preserved (by design):**

- Temporary cache files
- Log files older than retention period

:::tip

Unlike switching between install types on Linux, Windows channel switching does not require manual backup and restore procedures. The MSI installer handles data preservation automatically.

3. **Verify the installation:**
    - The installer will automatically detect your existing installation
    - Upgrade to the Nightly channel
    - Preserve your configuration and data
    - Restart the Netdata service

</details>

### Method 2: PowerShell Installation (Automated)

:::warning
Silent installation isn't supported on Windows Server versions earlier than 2019 due to TLS compatibility issues.
Use the [GUI installer](#method-1-gui-installation-recommended) instead.
:::

<details>
<summary>Switch to Stable Channel via PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/latest/download/netdata-x64.msi -OutFile "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi"
msiexec /qn /i "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi" REINSTALL=ALL
```

</details>

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Switch to Nightly Channel via PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/netdata/netdata-nightlies/releases/latest/download/netdata-x64.msi -OutFile "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi"
msiexec /qn /i "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi" REINSTALL=ALL
```

</details>

### Method 3: PowerShell with Cloud Connection Preserved

<details>
<summary>Switch Channels with Explicit Cloud Settings</summary>

If you want to ensure your Netdata Cloud connection is maintained during the switch, you can provide your claim token and room IDs explicitly.

**Get your current cloud settings:**

```powershell
# Check current cloud configuration
Get-Content "C:\Program Files\Netdata\etc\netdata\cloud.d\cloud.conf"
```

Look for your `token` and `rooms` values.

**Switch to Stable with Cloud settings:**

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
$TOKEN = "<YOUR_CLOUD_TOKEN>"      # <-- Replace with your Netdata Cloud claim token
$ROOMS = "<YOUR_ROOM_IDS>"         # <-- Replace with your comma-separated Room IDs
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/netdata/netdata/releases/latest/download/netdata-x64.msi -OutFile "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi"
msiexec /qn /i "$env:TEMP\netdata-x64.msi" TOKEN="$TOKEN" ROOMS="$ROOMS"
```

</details>

## Understanding the REINSTALL=ALL Parameter

The `REINSTALL=ALL` parameter is a Windows Installer (MSI) standard option that forces reinstallation of all Netdata components, ensuring a clean upgrade path.

**When to use REINSTALL=ALL:**

- **Switching channels** (Stable â†” Nightly) - Recommended
- **Troubleshooting broken installation** - Essential
- **Upgrading within the same channel** - Optional

**When not to use REINSTALL = ALL:**

- Fresh installations (no existing Netdata)
- When you want minimal disruption (standard MSI upgrade is sufficient)

:::warning

The `REINSTALL = ALL` parameter ensures complete replacement of binaries but is not required for normal channel switches. The MSI installer handles upgrades automatically.

## Verification: Confirm Your Channel

After switching channels, verify which version you're running:

<details>
<summary>Check via Netdata Dashboard</summary>

1. Open your browser to `http: //localhost:19999`
2. Click the **Netdata logo** in the top-left corner
3. Look for the version number:

- **Stable**: `v2.1.0` (clean version number)
- **Nightly**: `v2.1.0-123-nightly` (includes commit hash)

</details>

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Check via PowerShell</summary>

```powershell
# Get installed Netdata version
Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*" |
        Where-Object {
            $_.DisplayName -like "*Netdata*"
        } |
        Select-Object DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher
```

**Example output:**

```
DisplayName    : Netdata
DisplayVersion : 2.1.0
Publisher      : Netdata Inc.
```

</details>

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Check Netdata Service Status</summary>

You can also verify the Netdata service is running through the Windows Services manager:

![Windows Services - Netdata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/docs-images/refs/heads/master/windows/release/windows-services-netdata.png)

Or check via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Check Netdata service status
Get-Service netdata | Select-Object Name, Status, DisplayName

# Check service executable path
Get-WmiObject win32_service | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'netdata' } | Select-Object PathName
```

</details>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<details>
<summary>Issue: "Another version is already installed"</summary>

**Symptoms**: MSI installer shows error about existing installation

**Solution 1**: Use the `REINSTALL=ALL` parameter explicitly:

```powershell
msiexec /qn /i netdata-x64.msi REINSTALL=ALL
```

**Solution 2**: Uninstall first via Windows Add/Remove Programs, then reinstall:

![Windows Add/Remove Programs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/docs-images/refs/heads/master/windows/release/windows-add-remove-programs.png)

Or uninstall via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Uninstall existing installation
msiexec /qn /x netdata-x64.msi

# Wait for uninstall to complete
Start-Sleep -Seconds 10

# Reinstall with new channel
msiexec /qn /i netdata-x64.msi TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>" ROOMS="<YOUR_ROOMS>"
```

</details>

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Issue: Cloud Connection Lost After Switch</summary>

**Symptoms**: After switching channels, node doesn't appear in Netdata Cloud

**Solution**: Reclaim the node:

```powershell
# Stop Netdata service
Stop-Service netdata

# Remove old cloud configuration
Remove-Item "C:\Program Files\Netdata\var\lib\netdata\cloud.d\*" -Force

# Reinstall with claim token
msiexec /qn /i netdata-x64.msi TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>" ROOMS="<YOUR_ROOMS>" REINSTALL=ALL

# Start service
Start-Service netdata
```

You can also verify the service status in Windows Services:

![Windows Services - Netdata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/docs-images/refs/heads/master/windows/release/windows-services-netdata.png)

</details>

<br/>

<details>
<summary>Issue: Service Won't Start After Switch</summary>

**Symptoms**: Netdata service fails to start after channel switch

**Solution**: Check service status and perform clean reinstall:

```powershell
# Check service status
Get-Service netdata

# Check Windows Event Log for errors
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Netdata -Newest 20

# Perform clean reinstall
msiexec /qn /x netdata-x64.msi
Remove-Item "C:\Program Files\Netdata" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "$env:PROGRAMDATA\Netdata" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
msiexec /qn /i netdata-x64.msi TOKEN="<YOUR_TOKEN>" ROOMS="<YOUR_ROOMS>"
```

If the service still won't start, check the Windows Services manager to ensure the Netdata service is present and configured correctly:

</details>

## Alternative: Using Windows Add/Remove Programs

For users who prefer the traditional Windows approach, you can also manage Netdata installations through the Windows Control Panel:

1. **Access Add/Remove Programs:**
    - Open Windows Settings â†’ Apps & features
    - Or search for "Add or remove programs" in the Start menu

2. **Locate Netdata:**
    - Find "Netdata" in the installed programs list
    - Note the current version number

   ![Windows Add/Remove Programs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/docs-images/refs/heads/master/windows/release/windows-add-remove-programs.png)

3. **Uninstall if needed:**
    - Click "Uninstall" to remove the current installation
    - Then install the new channel using the MSI installer

This method provides a familiar Windows experience but requires manual download and installation of the new channel.
