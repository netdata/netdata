## A

- [**Anomaly Advisor**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/guided-troubleshooting/machine-learning-powered-anomaly-advisor.md): A Netdata feature that lets you quickly surface potentially anomalous metrics and charts related to a particular highlight window of interest.

## C

- [**Collector**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/netdata-agent/metrics-collection.md#collector-architecture-and-terminology): A catch-all term for any Netdata process that gathers metrics from an endpoint.

- [**Community**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/rework-learn/docs/getting-started/introduction.md#community): As a company with a passion and genesis in open-source, we are not just very proud of our community, but we consider our users, fans, and chatters to be an imperative part of the Netdata experience and culture.

## D

- [**Distributed Architecture**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/netdata-architecture/distributed-data-architecture.md): The data architecture mindset with which Netdata was built, where all data are collected and stored on the edge, whenever it's possible, creating countless benefits. 

## G

- [**Guided Troubleshooting**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/guided-troubleshooting/Overview.md): Troubleshooting with our Machine-Learning-powered tools designed to give you a cutting edge advantage in your troubleshooting battles.

## H

- [**High Fidelity** or **High Fidelity Architecture**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/netdata-architecture/high-fidelity-monitoring.md): We consider Netdata's monitoring solution "high fidelity" because it provides real time metrics so you can view metrics/changes in seconds since their occur, the highest resolution of metrics to allow you to observe changes occur between seconds, gixed step metric collection to allow you to quantify your observation windows, and unlimited data to search for patterns in data that you don't even believe they are correlated.

## K

- [**Kickstart** or **Kickstart Script**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md): An automatic one-line installation script named 'kickstart.sh' that works on all Linux distributions and macOS.

## M

- [**Metrics Collection**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/rework-learn/docs/concepts/netdata-agent/metrics-collection.md):  With zero configuration, Netdata auto-detects thousands of data sources upon starting and immediately collects per-second metrics. Netdata can immediately collect metrics from these endpoints thanks to 300+ collectors, which all come pre-installed when you install Netdata.

- [**Metric Correlations**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/guided-troubleshooting/metric-correlations.md): A Netdata feature that lets you quickly find metrics and charts related to a particular window of interest that you want to explore further.

- [**Modules**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/rework-learn/docs/concepts/netdata-agent/metrics-collection.md#collector-architecture-and-terminology): A type of collector. 

## N

- [**Netdata**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/getting-started/introduction.md): Netdata is a monitoring tool designed by system administrators, DevOps engineers, and developers to collect everything, help you visualize
metrics, troubleshoot complex performance problems, and make data interoperable with the rest of your monitoring stack. 

## U

- [**Unlimited Scalability**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/concepts/netdata-architecture/unlimited-scalability.md): With Netdata's distributed architecture, you can seamless observe a couple, hundreds or 
even thousands of nodes. There are no actual bottlenecks especially if you retain metrics locally in the Agents.

## Z

- [**Zero Configuration**](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/rework-learn/docs/concepts/netdata-architecture/zero-configuration.md): Netdata is preconfigured and capable to autodetect and monitor any well known application that runs on your system. You just deploy and claim Netdata Agents in your Netdata space, and monitor them in seconds.
