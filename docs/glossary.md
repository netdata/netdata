- [**Kubernetes Dashboard** or **Kubernetes Tab**](/docs/dashboards-and-charts/kubernetes-tab.md): Netdata Cloud features enhanced visualizations for the resource utilization of Kubernetes (k8s) clusters, embedded in the default Overview dashboard.

## M

- [**Metrics Collection**](/src/collectors/README.md): With zero configuration, Netdata auto-detects thousands of data sources upon starting and immediately collects per-second metrics. Netdata can immediately collect metrics from these endpoints thanks to 300+ collectors, which all come pre-installed when you install Netdata.

- [**Metric Correlations**](/docs/metric-correlations.md): A Netdata feature that lets you quickly find metrics and charts related to a particular window of interest that you want to explore further.

- [**Metrics Exporting**](/docs/exporting-metrics/README.md): Netdata allows you to export metrics to external time-series databases with the exporting engine. This system uses a number of connectors to initiate connections to more than thirty supported databases, including InfluxDB, Prometheus, Graphite, ElasticSearch, and much more.

- [**Metrics Storage**](/src/database/README.md#modes): Upon collection the collected metrics need to be either forwarded, exported or just stored for further treatment. The Agent is capable to store metrics both short and long-term, with or without the usage of non-volatile storage.

- [**Metrics Streaming Replication**](/docs/observability-centralization-points/README.md): Each node running Netdata can stream the metrics it collects, in real time, to another node.

  even thousands of nodes. There are no actual bottlenecks especially if you retain metrics locally in the Agents.

## V
