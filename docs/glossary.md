# Glossary

The Netdata community welcomes engineers, SREs, admins, etc. of all levels of expertise with engineering and the Netdata tool. And just as a journey of a thousand miles starts with one step, sometimes, the journey to mastery begins with understanding a single term.

As such, we want to provide a little Glossary as a reference starting point for new users who might be confused about the Netdata vernacular that more familiar users might take for granted.

If you're here looking for the definition of a term you heard elsewhere in our community or products, or if you just want to learn Netdata from the ground up, you've come to the right page.

Use the alphabatized list below to find the answer to your single-term questions, and click the bolded list items to explore more on the topics! We'll be sure to keep constantly updating this list, so if you hear a word that you would like for us to cover, just let us know or submit a request!
