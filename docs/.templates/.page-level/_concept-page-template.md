# Title

Why should the reader care: “What’s in it for me?”

## Subheading

Ideally, try to explain one core idea per section. Questions that you could keep in mind while writing: 

- How does it work?
- What are the outcomes?
- What are the positive and negative effects of it?
- Are there alternatives that provide a similar result?

## Subheading

Add more subheadings and anything else that needs to be explained...
Remember, if you start to describe about another concept, stop yourself.
Each concept should be about one concept only.
