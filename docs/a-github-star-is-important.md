# A GitHub star is important

**GitHub stars** allow Netdata to expand its reach, its community, especially attract people with skills willing to
contribute to it.

Compared to its first release, Netdata is now **twice as fast**, has all its bugs settled and a lot more functionality.
This happened because a lot of people find it useful, use it daily at home and work, **rely on it** and **contribute to
it**.

**GitHub stars** also **motivate** us. They state that you find our work **useful**. They give us strength to continue,
to work **harder** to make it even **better**.

So, give Netdata a **GitHub star**, at the top right of this page.

Thank you!
