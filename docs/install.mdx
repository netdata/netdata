# Install Netdata

Netdata is an open-source monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from any physical or
virtual system (we call them _nodes_) and organizes them in easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with Netdata Cloud, you can monitor your entire infrastructure in real time and easily troubleshoot problems
that threaten the health of your nodes before they occur.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

## Install Netdata on Linux

The **recommended** way to install the Netdata Agent on a Linux system is our one-line [kickstart
script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata
from its source code.

> ⚠️ Many Linux distributions ship with third-party packages of Netdata, which we can't maintain and are often missing
> features. For the complete Netdata experience, use this one-line kickstart, or an [alternative method for
> Linux](/packaging/installer/README.md#alternative-methods).

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter` to begin the installation process.

## Open and explore the dashboard

To open Netdata's dashboard, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either
`localhost` for a local system, or the hostname/IP address of a remote system.

dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80825153-abaec600-8b94-11ea-8b17-1b770a2abaa9.gif)

Netdata's dashboard is a single page with hundreds of preconfigured charts and thousands of metrics that update every
second. To see more charts, scroll down or use the **menu** on the right-hand side of the dashboard to navigate between
**sections**, which are groups of closely-related charts. 

![Animated GIF of using the menus and
submenus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80832425-7c528600-8ba1-11ea-8140-d0a17a62009b.gif)

## Interact with charts

Every chart in the Netdata dashboard is fully interactive, and these interactions are synchronized across all charts.
Here's what that looks like:

![Animated GIF of the standard Netdata dashboard being manipulated and synchronizing
charts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1153921/80839230-b034a800-8baf-11ea-9cb2-99c1e10f0f85.gif)

Let's cover two of the most important ways to interact with charts: panning through time and zooming.

To pan through time, **click and hold** (or touch and hold) on any chart, then **drag your mouse** (or finger) to the
left or right. Dragging to the right pans backward through time, while dragging to the left pans forward in time. Think
of it like pushing the current timeframe off the screen so you can see what came before or after.

To zoom, press and hold `Shift` or `Alt`, then use your mouse's scrollwheel, or a two-finger pinch if you're using a
touchpad.

## What's next?

You've now installed Netdata, visited the dashboard at `http://NODE:19999`, learned the basics of getting around, and
learned how to interact with charts by zooming and panning through time.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Dashboards

Learn more about [navigating the dashboard and interacting with charts](/docs/visualize/interact-dashboards-charts.md).

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built-in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Data collection

If you're not seeing certain metrics after installing Netdata, learn more about [how data collectors
work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md), then configure your system/services to publish their metrics in a way that
Netdata autodetects.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or [enable
notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Need to monitor multiple nodes in one place?

For robust infrastructure monitoring from a single interface, consider [Netdata
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), which streams, aggregates, and visualizes metrics from any number of
nodes. It's all the same out-of-the-box functionality of the open-source monitoring agent, but for entire
infrastructure.

If you're not interested in Netdata Cloud, each node can [stream](/streaming/README.md) its metrics to any other node,
and the default [registry](/registry/README.md) is configurable to create a private "network" of Netdata dashboards.
