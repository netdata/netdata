# Get Netdata

import { OneLineInstall } from '../src/components/OneLineInstall/'
import { Install, InstallBox } from '../src/components/InstallBox/'

Netdata uses an open-source monitoring Agent and web application [together](/docs/overview/what-is-netdata.md) to help
you collect every metric, visualize the health of your systems, and troubleshoot complex performance problems. Once
you've signed in to Netdata Cloud and installed the Netdata Agent on all your nodes, you can claim these nodes and see
their real-time metrics on a single interface.

## Sign in to Netdata Cloud

If you don't already have a free Netdata Cloud account, go ahead and [create one](https://app.netdata.cloud).

Choose your preferred authentication method and follow the onboarding process to create your Space.

## Install the Netdata Agent

The Netdata Agent runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT
devices. It runs on Linux distributions (**Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **CentOS**, and more), container/microservice platforms
(**Kubernetes** clusters, **Docker**), and many other operating systems (**FreeBSD**, **macOS**), with no `sudo`
required.

> ⚠️ Many distributions ship with third-party packages of Netdata, which we cannot maintain or keep up-to-date. For the
> best experience, use one of the methods described or link to below.

The **recommended** way to install the Netdata Agent on a Linux system is our one-line [kickstart
script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata
from its source code.

<OneLineInstall />

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter`. 

Open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:19999` or `http://REMOTE-HOST:19999` to open the dashboard.

## Claim your node on Netdata Cloud

You need to [claim](/claim/README.md) your nodes to see them in Netdata Cloud. Claiming establishes a secure TLS
connection to Netdata Cloud using the [Agent-Cloud link](/aclk/README.md), and proves you have write and administrative
access to that node.

When you view a node in Netdata Cloud, the Agent running on that node streams metrics, metadata, and alarm status to
Netdata Cloud, which in turn streams those metrics to your web browser. Netdata Cloud does not store or log metrics or
alarm status.

To claim a node, you need to run the claiming script. In Netdata Cloud, click on your Space's name, then **Manage your
Space** in the dropdown. Click **Nodes** in the panel that appears. Copy the script and run it in your node's terminal.
For example:

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.` after creating a new RSA pair and establishing the link to
Netdata Cloud.

For more information on the claiming process, why we implemented it, and how it works, see the [claim](/claim/README.md)
and [Agent-Cloud link](/aclk/README.md) reference docs.

## What's next?

At this point, you have set up your free Netdata Cloud account, installed the Agent, and claimed one or more nodes to
your Space. You're ready to start monitoring, visualizing, and troubleshooting with Netdata. We have two quickstart
guides based on the scope of what you need to monitor:

Interested in monitoring a single node? Check out our [single-node monitoring
quickstart](/docs/quickstart/single-node.md).

If you're looking to monitor an entire infrastructure with Netdata, see the [infrastructure monitoring
quickstart](/docs/quickstart/infrastructure.md).
