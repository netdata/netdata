## Steps

1. Click on the **Alerts** view
2. Click on the **Active** tab
3. You will be presented with a table of the active alerts (if any), containing info about the:
    - Alert Status
    - Alert name
    - Latest Value
    - Latest Updated timestamp
    - Triggered Value
    - Triggered Node
    - Chart Id
4. Inspect the alerts by sorting the results by these columns, or filtering from the right tab in the interface, using the following filters.
    - Status (Critical/Warning)
