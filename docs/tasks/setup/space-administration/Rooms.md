War Rooms organize your connected nodes and provide infrastructure-wide dashboards using real-time metrics and
visualizations.

Once you add nodes to a Space, all of your nodes will be visible in the **All nodes War Room**. This is a special War
Room which gives you an overview of all of your nodes in this particular space. Then you can create functional
separations of your nodes into more War Rooms. Every War Room has its own dashboards, navigation, indicators, and
management tools.

:::note
Some of these actions can be configured to be accessible to normal users too instead of being admin-only, you can read
more in
the [Space administration](https://github.com/netdata/learn/blob/master/docs/tasks/setup/space-administration/space-administration.md#manage-permissions)
