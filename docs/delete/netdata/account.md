# How to Delete Your Netdata Account

:::note

Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data, configurations, and settings will be permanently removed. If you wish to use Netdata again in the future, you'll need to create a new account and reconfigure everything from scratch.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Access Your Profile Settings

Navigate to the Netdata UI and locate your **user profile icon** in the bottom-left corner of the interface. Click on it to open the profile menu.

### Step 2: Open Settings

From the profile menu, click on **"Settings"** to access your account settings page.

### Step 3: Locate the Delete Account Option

Once in the Settings page, your profile information will appear in a pop-up window on the right side of the screen. Scroll to the bottom of this pop-up where you'll find the **"Delete account"** option in red text.

### Step 4: Confirm Account Deletion

Click on **"Delete account"**. A confirmation dialog will appear with the following warning:

- You are about to delete your account at Netdata
- All data related to your account will be deleted
- This cannot be undone

### Step 5: Final Confirmation

You have two options:

| Action | Button | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cancel** | Green button | Returns you to settings without deleting account |
| **Yes, delete** | Red button | Permanently deletes your account immediately |

## Important Considerations

Before deleting your account, consider:

- **Data Loss**: All monitoring configurations, custom dashboards, alert settings, and historical data will be permanently lost
- **Connected Nodes**: Any nodes connected to your account will need to be reconfigured with a new account
- **Team access**: If you're part of a team workspace, ensure you've transferred any necessary permissions or data
- **No recovery**: There is no grace period or recovery option once deletion is confirmed

## Alternative Options

Before deleting your account, consider these alternatives:

1. **Pause Monitoring** - Temporarily disable monitoring without losing configurations
2. **Sign Out** - Simply sign out if you need a break from the platform
3. **Contact Support** - Reach out to [Netdata support](https://www.netdata.cloud/contact/) if you're experiencing resolvable issues
4. **Disable Notifications** - Turn off alerts if they're overwhelming
