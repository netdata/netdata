### Step 4: Confirm Account Deletion

Click on **"Delete account"**. A confirmation dialog will appear with the following warning:

### Step 5: Final Confirmation

You have two options:

| Action | Button | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Cancel** | Green button | Returns you to settings without deleting account |
| **Yes, delete** | Red button | Permanently deletes your account immediately |

## Important Considerations

Before deleting your account, consider:

- **Team access**: If you're part of a team Space, ensure you've transferred any necessary permissions
- **No recovery**: There is no grace period or recovery option once deletion is confirmed

## Alternative Options

Before deleting your account, consider these alternatives:

1. **Pause Monitoring** - Temporarily disable monitoring without losing configurations
2. **Sign Out** - Simply sign out if you need a break from the platform
3. **Contact Support** - Reach out to [Netdata support](https://www.netdata.cloud/support/) if you're experiencing resolvable issues
4. **Disable Notifications** - Turn off alerts if they're overwhelming
