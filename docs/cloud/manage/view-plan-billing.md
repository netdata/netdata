# View Plan & Billing

From the Cloud interface, you can view and manage your space's plan and billing settings, and see the space's usage in terms of running nodes.

To view and manage some specific settings, related to billing options and invoices, you'll be redirected to our billing provider Customer Portal.

## Prerequisites

To see your plan and billing setting you need:

- A Cloud account
- Access to the space as an Administrator or Billing user

      - Daily count - The weighted 90th percentile of the live node count during the day, taking time as the weight. If you have 30 live nodes throughout the day
      except for a two hour peak of 44 live nodes, the daily value is 31.
      - Period count: The 90th percentile of the daily counts for this period up to the date. The last value for the period is used as the number of nodes for the bill for that period. See more details in [running nodes and billing](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/manage/plans.md#running-nodes-and-billing) (only applicable if you are on a paid plan subscription)

## FAQ

### 1. What Payment Methods are accepted?

You can easily pay online via most major Credit/Debit Cards. More payment options are expected to become available in the near future.

### 2. What happens if a renewal payment fails?

After an initial failed payment, we will attempt to process your payment every week for the next 15 days. After three failed attempts your Space will be moved to the **Community** plan (free forever).

For the next 24 hours, you will be able to use all your current notification method configurations. After 24 hours, any of the notification method configurations that aren't available on your space's plan will be automatically disabled.

Cancellation might affect users in your Space. Please check what roles are available on the [Community plan](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/manage/plans.md#areas-impacted-by-plans). Users with unavailable roles on the Community plan will immediately have restricted access to the Space.

### 3. Which currencies do you support?

We currently accept payments only in US Dollars (USD). We currently have plans to also accept payments in Euros (EUR), but do not currently have an estimate for when such support will be available.

### 4. Can I get a refund? How?

Payments for Netdata subscriptions are refundable **only** if you cancel your subscription within 14 days of purchase. The refund will be credited to the Credit/Debit Card used for making the purchase. To request a refund, please email us at [billing@netdata.cloud](mailto:billing@netdata.cloud).

### 5. How do I cancel my paid Plan?

Your annual or monthly Netdata Subscription plan will automatically renew until you cancel it. You can cancel your paid plan at any time by clicking ‘Cancel Plan’ from the **Plan & Billing** section under settings. You can also cancel your paid Plan by clicking the _Select_ button under **Community** plan in the **Plan & Billing** Section under Settings.

### 6. How can I access my Invoices/Receipts after I paid for a Plan?

You can visit the _Billing Options & Invoices_ in the **Plan & Billing** section under settings in your Netdata Space where you can find all your Invoicing history.

### 7. Why do I see two separate Invoices?

Every time you purchase or renew a Plan, two separate Invoices are generated:

- One Invoice includes the recurring fees of the Plan you have chosen

- The other Invoice includes your monthly “On Demand - Usage”.

  Right after the activation of your subscription, you will receive a zero value Invoice since you had no usage when you subscribed.
  
  On the following month you will receive an Invoice based on your monthly usage.

You can find some further details on the [Netdata Plans page](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/manage/plans.md#plans).

> ⚠️ We expect this to change to a single invoice in the future, but currently do not have a concrete timeline for when this change will happen.

### 8. How is the **Total Before Tax** value calculated on plan changes?

When you change your plan we will be calculating the residual before tax value you have from the _Unused time on your current plan_ in order to credit you with this value.  

After that, we will be performing the following calculations:

1. Get the **Subscription total** (total amount to be paid for Nodes and Space)
2. Deduct any Discount applicable from promotion codes
3. If an amount remains, then we deduct the sum of the _Unused time on current plan_ then and the Credit amount from any existing credit balance. 
4. The result, if positive, is the Total Before Tax, if applicable, any sales tax (VAT or other) will apply. 

If  the calculation of step 3 returns a negative amount then this amount will be your new customer credit balance.
