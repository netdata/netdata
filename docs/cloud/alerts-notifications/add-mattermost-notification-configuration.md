   - If you donâ€™t have the Integrations option, incoming webhooks may not be enabled on your Mattermost server or may be disabled for non-admins. They can be enabled by a System Admin from System Console > Integrations > Integration Management. Once incoming webhooks are enabled, continue with the steps below

4. You will end up with a webhook endpoint that looks like so:
```

```
   - Treat this endpoint as a secret. Anyone who has it will be able to post messages to your Mattermost instance.
