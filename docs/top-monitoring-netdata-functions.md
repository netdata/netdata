# Top Monitoring (Netdata Functions)

Netdata Agent collectors are able to expose functions that can be executed in run-time and on-demand. These will be
executed on the node/host where the function is made available.

## What is a function?

Collectors besides the metric collection, storing, and/or streaming work are capable of executing specific routines on request. These routines will bring additional information to help you troubleshoot or even trigger some action to happen on the node itself.

For more details please check out documentation on how we use our internal collector to get this from the first collector that exposes functions - [plugins.d](/src/collectors/plugins.d/README.md#function).

## Prerequisites

The following is required to be able to run Functions from Netdata Cloud.

- At least one of the nodes claimed to your Space should be on a Netdata agent version higher than `v1.37.1`
- Ensure that the node has the collector that exposes the function you want enabled

## How do functions work with streaming?

Via streaming, the definitions of functions are transmitted to a parent node, so it knows all the functions available on any children connected to it. If the parent node is the one connected to Netdata Cloud it is capable of triggering the call to the respective children node to run the function.

## Why are some functions only available on Netdata Cloud?

Since these functions are able to execute routines on the node and due to the potential use cases that they can cover, our concern is to ensure no sensitive information or disruptive actions are exposed through the Agent's API.

With the communication between the Netdata Agent and Netdata Cloud being through [ACLK](/src/aclk/README.md) this concern is addressed.
