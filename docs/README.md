# Read documentation on <https://docs.netdata.cloud>

Welcome to the Netdata documentation! While you can read Netdata documentation here, or throughout the Netdata repository, our intention is that these pages are read on [docs.netdata.cloud](https://docs.netdata.cloud). 

Links between documentation pages will work fine here, but the formatting may not be perfect, as our documentation site uses a few extra Markdown features that GitHub doesn't support natively. Other things might be missing or look less than perfect.

Now get out there and build an exceptional infrastructure.
