# Security and privacy design

This document serves as the relevant Annex to the [Terms of Service](https://www.netdata.cloud/service-terms/), the [Privacy Policy](https://www.netdata.cloud/privacy/) and
the Data Processing Addendum, when applicable. It provides more information regarding Netdata’s technical and organizational security and privacy measures.

We have given special attention to all aspects of Netdata, ensuring that everything throughout its operation is as secure as possible. Netdata has been designed with security in mind.

## Netdata's Security Principles

### Security by Design

Netdata, an open-source software widely installed across the globe, prioritizes security by design, showcasing our commitment to safeguarding user data. The entire structure and internal architecture of the software is built to ensure maximum security. We aim to provide a secure environment from the ground up, rather than as an afterthought.

### Compliance with Open Source Security Foundation Best Practices

Netdata is committed to adhering to the best practices laid out by the Open Source Security Foundation. Currently, the Netdata Agent aligns with these practices by 93%. The remainder primarily pertains to automated testing coverage, which is challenging due to the nature of our collectors. Nevertheless, we strive to improve this percentage by continuously seeking innovative solutions.

Netdata Cloud boasts of comprehensive end-to-end automated testing, encompassing the UI, back-end, and agents, where involved. In addition, the Netdata Agent uses an array of third-party services for static code analysis, static code security analysis, and CI/CD integrations to ensure code quality on a per pull request basis. Tools like Github's CodeQL, Github's Dependabot, our own unit tests, various types of linters, and [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/netdata-netdata?tab=overview) are utilized to this end.

Moreover, each PR requires two code reviews from our senior engineers before being merged. We also maintain two high-performance environments (a production-like kubernetes cluster and a highly demanding stress lab) for stress-testing our entire solution. This robust pipeline ensures the delivery of high-quality software consistently.


### Regular Third-Party Testing and Isolation

While Netdata doesn't have a dedicated internal security team, the open-source Netdata Agent undergoes regular testing by third parties. Any security reports received are addressed immediately. In contrast, Netdata Cloud operates in a fully automated and isolated environment with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring no direct access to production applications. Monitoring and reporting is also fully automated.


### Security Vulnerability Response

Netdata has a transparent and structured process for handling security vulnerabilities. We appreciate and value the contributions of security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to us. All reports are thoroughly investigated, and any identified vulnerabilities trigger a Security Release Process.

We aim to fully disclose any bugs as soon as a user mitigation is available, typically within a week of the report. In case of security fixes, we promptly release a new version of the software. Users can subscribe to our releases on GitHub to stay updated about all security incidents. More details about our vulnerability response process can be found [here](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/policy).


### Adherence to Open Source Security Foundation Best Practices

In line with our commitment to security, we uphold the best practices as outlined by the Open Source Security Foundation. This commitment reflects in every aspect of our operations, from the design phase to the release process, ensuring the delivery of a secure and reliable product to our users. For more information check [here](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/2231).

## Netdata Agent Security

### Security by Design

Netdata Agent is designed with a security-first approach. Its structure ensures data safety by only exposing chart metadata and metric values, not the raw data collected. This design principle allows Netdata to be used in environments requiring the highest level of data isolation, such as PCI Level 1. Even though Netdata plugins connect to a user's database server or read application log files to collect raw data, only the processed metrics are stored in Netdata databases, sent to upstream Netdata servers, or archived to external time-series databases.

### User Data Protection

The Netdata Agent is programmed to safeguard user data. When collecting data, the raw data does not leave the host. All plugins, even those running with escalated capabilities or privileges, perform a hard-coded data collection job. They do not accept commands from Netdata, and the original application data collected do not leave the process they are collected in, are not saved, and are not transferred to the Netdata daemon. For the “Functions” feature, the data collection plugins offer Functions, and the user interface merely calls them back as defined by the data collector. The Netdata Agent main process does not require any escalated capabilities or privileges from the operating system, and neither do most of the data collecting plugins.

### Communication and Data Encryption

Data collection plugins communicate with the main Netdata process via ephemeral, in-memory, pipes that are inaccessible to any other process.

Streaming of metrics between Netdata agents requires an API key and can also be encrypted with TLS if the user configures it.

The Netdata agent's web API can also use TLS if configured.

When Netdata agents are claimed to Netdata Cloud, the communication happens via MQTT over Web Sockets over TLS, and public/private keys are used for authorizing access. These keys are exchanged during the claiming process (usually during the provisioning of each agent).

### Authentication

Direct user access to the agent is not authenticated, considering that users should either use Netdata Cloud, or they are already on the same LAN, or they have configured proper firewall policies. However, Netdata agents can be hidden behind an authenticating web proxy if required.

For other Netdata agents streaming metrics to an agent, authentication via API keys is required and TLS can be used if configured.

For Netdata Cloud accessing Netdata agents, public/private key cryptography is used and TLS is mandatory.

### Security Vulnerability Response

If a security vulnerability is found in the Netdata Agent, the Netdata team acknowledges and analyzes each report within three working days, kicking off a Security Release Process. Any vulnerability information shared with the Netdata team stays within the Netdata project and is not disseminated to other projects unless necessary for fixing the issue. The reporter is kept updated as the security issue moves from triage to identified fix, to release planning. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/security/policy).

### Protection Against Common Security Threats

The Netdata agent is resilient against common security threats such as DDoS attacks and SQL injections. For DDoS, Netdata agent uses a fixed number of threads for processing requests, providing a cap on the resources that can be consumed. It also automatically manages its memory to prevent overutilization. SQL injections are prevented as nothing from the UI is passed back to the data collection plugins accessing databases.

Additionally, the Netdata agent is running as a normal, unprivileged, operating system user (a few data collections require escalated privileges, but these privileges are isolated to just them), every netdata process runs by default with a nice priority to protect production applications in case the system is starving for CPU resources, and Netdata agents are configured by default to be the first processes to be killed by the operating system in case the operating system starves for memory resources (OS-OOM - Operating System Out Of Memory events).

### User Customizable Security Settings

Netdata provides users with the flexibility to customize agent security settings. Users can configure TLS across the system, and the agent provides extensive access control lists on all its interfaces to limit access to its endpoints based on IP. Additionally, users can configure the CPU and Memory priority of Netdata agents.

## Netdata Cloud Security

Netdata Cloud is designed with a security-first approach to ensure the highest level of protection for user data. When using Netdata Cloud in environments that require compliance with standards like PCI DSS, SOC 2, or HIPAA, users can be confident that all collected data is stored within their infrastructure. Data viewed on dashboards and alert notifications travel over Netdata Cloud, but are not stored—instead, they're transformed in transit, aggregated from multiple agents and parents (centralization points), to appear as one data source in the user's browser.

### User Identification and Authorization

Netdata Cloud requires only an email address to create an account and use the service. User identification and authorization are conducted either via third-party integrations (Google, GitHub accounts) or through short-lived access tokens sent to the user’s email account. Email addresses are stored securely in our production database on AWS and are also used for product and marketing communications. Netdata Cloud does not store user credentials.

### Data Storage and Transfer

Although Netdata Cloud does not store metric data, it does keep some metadata for each node connected to user spaces. This metadata includes the hostname, information from the `/api/v1/info` endpoint, metric metadata from `/api/v1/contexts`, and alerts configurations from `/api/v1/alarms`. This data is securely stored in our production database on AWS and copied to Google BigQuery for analytics purposes.

All data visible on Netdata Cloud is transferred through the Agent-Cloud link (ACLK) mechanism, which securely connects a Netdata Agent to Netdata Cloud. The ACLK is encrypted and safe, and is only established if the user connects/claims their node. Data in transit between a user and Netdata Cloud is encrypted using TLS.

### Data Retention and Erasure

Netdata Cloud maintains backups of customer content for approximately 90 days following a deletion. Users have the ability to access, retrieve, correct, and delete personal data stored in Netdata Cloud. In case a user is unable to delete personal data via self-services functionality, Netdata will delete personal data upon the customer's written request, in accordance with applicable data protection law.

### Infrastructure and Authentication

Netdata Cloud operates on an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) model. Its microservices environment is completely isolated, and all changes occur through Terraform. At the edge of Netdata Cloud, there is a TLS termination and an Identity and Access Management (IAM) service that validates JWT tokens included in request cookies.

Netdata Cloud does not store user credentials.

### Security Features and Response

Netdata Cloud offers a variety of security features, including infrastructure-level dashboards, centralized alerts notifications, auditing logs, and role-based access to different segments of the infrastructure. The cloud service employs several protection mechanisms against DDoS attacks, such as rate-limiting and automated blacklisting. It also uses static code analysers to prevent other types of attacks.

In the event of potential security vulnerabilities or incidents, Netdata Cloud follows the same process as the Netdata agent. Every report is acknowledged and analyzed by the Netdata team within three working days, and the team keeps the reporter updated throughout the process.

### User Customization

Netdata Cloud uses the highest level of security. There is no user customization available out of the box. Its security settings are designed to provide maximum protection for all users. We are offering customization (like custom SSO integrations, custom data retention policies, advanced user access controls, tailored audit logs, integration with other security tools, etc.) on a per contract basis.

### Deleting Personal Data

Users who wish to remove all personal data (including email and activities) can delete their cloud account by logging into Netdata Cloud and accessing their profile.

## User Privacy and Data Protection

Netdata Cloud is built with an unwavering commitment to user privacy and data protection. We understand that our users' data is both sensitive and valuable, and we have implemented stringent measures to ensure its safety.

### Data Collection

Netdata Cloud collects minimal personal information from its users. The only personal data required to create an account and use the service is an email address. This email address is used for product and marketing communications. Additionally, the IP address used to access Netdata Cloud is stored in web proxy access logs.

### Data Usage

The collected email addresses are stored in our production database on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and copied to Google BigQuery, our data lake, for analytics purposes. These analytics are crucial for our product development process. If a user accepts the use of analytical cookies, their email address and IP are stored in the systems we use to track application usage (Google Analytics, Posthog, and Gainsight PX). Subscriptions and Payments data are handled by Stripe.

### Data Sharing

Netdata Cloud does not share any personal data with third parties, ensuring the privacy of our users' data, but Netdata Cloud does use third parties for its services, including, but not limited to, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services for its infrastructure, Stripe for payment processing, Google Analytics, Posthog and Gainsight PX for analytics.

### Data Protection

We use state-of-the-art security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. All infrastructure data visible on Netdata Cloud passes through the Agent-Cloud Link (ACLK) mechanism, which securely connects a Netdata Agent to Netdata Cloud. The ACLK is encrypted, safe, and is only established if the user connects their node. All data in transit between a user and Netdata Cloud is encrypted using TLS.

### User Control over Data

Netdata provides its users with the ability to access, retrieve, correct, and delete their personal data stored in Netdata Cloud. This ability may occasionally be limited due to temporary service outages for maintenance or other updates to Netdata Cloud, or when it is technically not feasible. If a customer is unable to delete personal data via the self-services functionality, Netdata deletes the data upon the customer's written request, within the timeframe specified in the Data Protection Agreement (DPA), and in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

### Compliance with Data Protection Laws

Netdata Cloud is fully compliant with data protection laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).

### Data Transfer

Data transfer within Netdata Cloud is secure and respects the privacy of the user data. The Netdata Agent establishes an outgoing secure WebSocket (WSS) connection to Netdata Cloud, ensuring that the data is encrypted when in transit.

### Use of Tracking Technologies

Netdata Cloud uses analytical cookies if a user consents to their use. These cookies are used to track the usage of the application and are stored in systems like Google Analytics, Posthog and Gainsight PX.

### Data Breach Notification Process

In the event of a data breach, Netdata has a well-defined process in place for notifying users. The details of this process align with the standard procedures and timelines defined in the Data Protection Agreement (DPA).

We continually review and update our privacy and data protection practices to ensure the highest level of data safety and privacy for our users.

## Compliance with Regulations

Netdata is committed to ensuring the security, privacy, and integrity of user data. It complies with both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.

### Compliance with GDPR and CCPA

Compliance with GDPR and CCPA are self-assessment processes, and Netdata has undertaken thorough internal audits and controls to ensure it meets all requirements.

As per request basis, any customer may enter with Netdata into a data processing addendum (DPA) governing customer’s ability to load and permit Netdata to process any personal data or information regulated under applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR and CCPA.

### Data Transfers

While Netdata Agent itself does not engage in any cross-border data transfers, certain personal and infrastructure data is transferred to Netdata Cloud for the purpose of providing its services. The metric data collected and processed by Netdata Agents, however, stays strictly within the user's infrastructure, eliminating any concerns about cross-border data transfer issues.

When users utilize Netdata Cloud, the metric data is streamed directly from the Netdata Agent to the users’ web browsers via Netdata Cloud, without being stored on Netdata Cloud's servers. However, user identification data (such as email addresses) and infrastructure metadata necessary for Netdata Cloud's operation are stored in data centers in the United States, using compliant infrastructure providers such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. These transfers and storage are carried out in full compliance with applicable data protection laws, including GDPR and CCPA.

### Privacy Rights

Netdata ensures user privacy rights as mandated by the GDPR and CCPA. This includes the right to access, correct, and delete personal data. These functions are all available online via the Netdata Cloud User Interface (UI). In case a user wants to remove all personal information (email and activities), they can delete their cloud account by logging into https://app.netdata.cloud and accessing their profile, at the bottom left of the screen.

### Regular Review and Updates

Netdata is dedicated to keeping its practices up-to-date with the latest developments in data protection regulations. Therefore, as soon as updates or changes are made to these regulations, Netdata reviews and updates its policies and practices accordingly to ensure continual compliance.

While Netdata is confident in its compliance with GDPR and CCPA, users are encouraged to review Netdata's privacy policy and reach out with any questions or concerns they may have about data protection and privacy.

## Anonymous Statistics

The anonymous statistics collected by the Netdata Agent are related to the installations and not to individual users. This data includes community size, types of plugins used, possible crashes, operating systems installed, and the use of the registry feature. No IP addresses are collected, but each Netdata installation has a unique ID.

Netdata also collects anonymous telemetry events, which provide information on the usage of various features, errors, and performance metrics. This data is used to understand how the software is being used and to identify areas for improvement.

The purpose of collecting these statistics and telemetry data is to guide the development of the open-source agent, focusing on areas that are most beneficial to users.

Users have the option to opt out of this data collection during the installation of the agent, or at any time by removing a specific file from their system.

Netdata retains this data indefinitely in order to track changes and trends within the community over time.

Netdata does not share these anonymous statistics or telemetry data with any third parties.

By collecting this data, Netdata is able to continuously improve their service and identify any issues or areas for improvement, while respecting user privacy and maintaining transparency.

## PCI DSS

PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

Netdata is committed to providing secure and privacy-respecting services, and it aligns its practices with many of the key principles of the PCI DSS. However, it's important to clarify that Netdata is not officially certified as PCI DSS-compliant. While Netdata follows practices that align with PCI DSS's key principles, the company itself has not undergone the formal certification process for PCI DSS compliance.

PCI DSS compliance is not just about the technical controls but also involves a range of administrative and procedural safeguards that go beyond the scope of Netdata's services. These include, among other things, maintaining a secure network, implementing strong access control measures, regularly monitoring and testing networks, and maintaining an information security policy.

Therefore, while Netdata can support entities with their data security needs in relation to PCI DSS, it is ultimately the responsibility of the entity to ensure full PCI DSS compliance across all of their operations. Entities should always consult with a legal expert or a PCI DSS compliance consultant to ensure that their use of any product, including Netdata, aligns with PCI DSS regulations.

## HIPAA

HIPAA stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which is a United States federal law enacted in 1996. HIPAA is primarily focused on protecting the privacy and security of individuals' health information.

Netdata is committed to providing secure and privacy-respecting services, and it aligns its practices with many key principles of HIPAA. However, it's important to clarify that Netdata is not officially certified as HIPAA-compliant. While Netdata follows practices that align with HIPAA's key principles, the company itself has not undergone the formal certification process for HIPAA compliance.

HIPAA compliance is not just about technical controls but also involves a range of administrative and procedural safeguards that go beyond the scope of Netdata's services. These include, among other things, employee training, physical security, and contingency planning.

Therefore, while Netdata can support HIPAA-regulated entities with their data security needs and is prepared to sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), it is ultimately the responsibility of the healthcare entity to ensure full HIPAA compliance across all of their operations. Entities should always consult with a legal expert or a HIPAA compliance consultant to ensure that their use of any product, including Netdata, aligns with HIPAA regulations.
