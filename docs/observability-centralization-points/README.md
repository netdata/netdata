# **Observability Centralization Points**

Netdata allows you to set up multiple **Observability Centralization Points** to aggregate metrics, logs, and metadata across your infrastructure.

## **Why Use Centralization Points?**

- **Ephemeral Systems**:
    - Ideal for **Kubernetes nodes or temporary VMs** that frequently go offline.
    - Ensures metrics and logs remain available for analysis and troubleshooting.

- **Limited Resources**:
    - Offloads observability tasks from systems with **low disk space, CPU, RAM, or I/O bandwidth**.
    - Keeps production systems running efficiently without performance trade-offs.

- **Multi-Node Dashboards Without Netdata Cloud**:
    - Aggregates data from multiple nodes for **centralized dashboards**, similar to Netdata Cloud.

- **Restricted Netdata Cloud Access**:
    - Acts as a **bridge** when monitored systems canâ€™t connect to Netdata Cloud due to **firewall restrictions**.

## **How Multiple Centralization Points Work**

- **With Netdata Cloud**:
    - Queries all centralization points in parallel for a unified view of the infrastructure.
- **Without Netdata Cloud**:
    - Parent nodes consolidate data from connected systems, providing a local view of metrics and logs.
