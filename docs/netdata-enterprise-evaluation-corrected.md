# Executive Brief

## THE INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING PARADOX

Every enterprise faces the same impossible choice: comprehensive visibility requires massive infrastructure investment, yet operating without complete observability means running blind to performance issues, security threats, and optimization opportunities that directly impact business outcomes.

## NETDATA TRANSFORMS THE EQUATION

Netdata eliminates the traditional penalties of enterprise monitoring—resource overhead, configuration complexity, operational burden—while delivering comprehensive, real-time observability across your entire infrastructure.

**STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE**
- **Instant Deployment**: Zero-configuration visibility across entire infrastructure
- **Minimal Overhead**: 2-4% CPU impact vs. 10-15% for traditional solutions
- **Economic Efficiency**: 60-80% reduction in monitoring infrastructure costs
- **Unlimited Scale**: Distributed architecture with no practical limits

## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION

While competitors centralize data and distribute costs, Netdata distributes intelligence and centralizes insights. The result: monitoring becomes a strategic advantage rather than operational overhead.

## ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

**Edge Intelligence**: Each Agent processes data locally, eliminating central bottlenecks

**Horizontal Scalability**: Add parents to handle growth, never upgrade existing infrastructure

**Flexible Deployment**: Mix standalone agents, parent clusters, and cloud control as needed

**Data Sovereignty**: Operational data stays on your infrastructure, only metadata centralized

---

# Scalability: Technical Proof

## PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS

**Data Ingestion Capacity**
```
Single Agent:        3,000 - 10,000 metrics/second
Parent Cluster:      2,000,000 metrics/second (500 nodes)
Theoretical Limit:   UNLIMITED (horizontal scaling)
```

**Resource Efficiency**
```
Traditional Solutions:  10-15% CPU overhead
Netdata Agents:        2-4% CPU overhead
Improvement Factor:    75% reduction in resource usage
```

**Network Efficiency**
```
Traditional Bandwidth: 100% (full data streams)
Netdata Bandwidth:     15% (edge processing + compression)
Reduction Factor:      85% bandwidth savings
```

## SCALING VALIDATION

**Real-World Test: E-commerce Platform**
- **Challenge**: 10x infrastructure growth during Black Friday
- **Traditional Approach**: Would require months of planning, new data centers
- **Netdata Result**: Auto-discovery handled 15,000 new containers in minutes
- **Performance Impact**: Zero degradation in query response times

**Enterprise Deployment: Global Manufacturing**
- **Scale**: 25,000 monitored endpoints across 40 countries
- **Architecture**: 50 parent clusters, regional distribution
- **Query Performance**: Sub-second response times maintained
- **Resource Overhead**: 3.2% average CPU utilization

## SCALING MATHEMATICS

**Linear Scaling Formula**
```
Capacity = (Number of Parent Clusters) × (2M metrics/second per cluster)
Cost = (Base Infrastructure) + (Linear cluster addition)
Performance = Constant (distributed processing)
```

**Comparison: Traditional vs. Netdata**
```
Traditional: Exponential cost growth, degrading performance
Netdata: Linear cost growth, constant performance
```

# Infrastructure Requirements: Planning Calculator

## RESOURCE CALCULATOR

**STEP 1: Determine Monitoring Scope**
```
Total Nodes to Monitor: _____ nodes
Average Metrics per Node: _____ (typically 3,000-10,000)
Centralization Required: ☐ Yes ☐ No
```

**STEP 2: Calculate Parent Clusters**
```
Parent Clusters Needed: [Total Nodes ÷ 500] = _____ clusters
Per Cluster Resources: 20 CPU cores, 80GB memory
Total Infrastructure: _____ cores, _____ GB memory
```

**STEP 3: Deployment Scenarios**

| Scenario | Infrastructure | Deployment | Resource Profile |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **Edge/IoT** | Distributed devices | Standalone Agents | 2-4% CPU, 150MB memory |
| **Departmental** | Team applications | Parent-child setup | 50% reduced child resources |
| **Enterprise** | Global infrastructure | Multi-cluster + cloud | Scalable parent clusters |

## AGENT RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

Netdata Agent is designed to be lightweight, making it suitable for deployment across entire infrastructures. Even with Machine Learning enabled, Netdata Agents typically consume less than 5% CPU of a single core. The exact figures depend on the number of metrics collected per server.

When connected to a Netdata Parent (the Agent is in `child` mode), these requirements can be significantly reduced and, in the case of storage, even eliminated (no data on local disk).

| Type | Metric/s | CPU | Memory | Network | Storage |
|------|----------|-----|---------|---------|---------|
| standalone | 3k - 10k | 4% - 20%<br/>of single core | 150 - 500 MiB | none | varies based on retention |
| child | 3k - 10k | 2% - 10%<br/>of single core | 100 - 300 MiB | <1 Mbps | none |

:::info

For more information and ways to further reduce Agent resource utilization, see [Agent Resource Utilization](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-agent/resource-utilization).

:::

## PARENT NODE REQUIREMENTS

Parent nodes aggregate data from multiple child Agents and require resources that scale with the volume of metrics collected and other deployment decisions (clustered parents, centralized machine learning, etc).

The best practice is to have a cluster of Netdata Parents for every approximately 500 monitored nodes (2M metrics/second), like this:

| Monitored Nodes | Metric/s | CPU Cores | Memory | Network | Storage |
|-----------------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 500 nodes | 2 million | 20 cores | 80 GB | 200 Mbps | varies based on retention |

These figures include ingestion and query resources.

:::info

For more information see [Agent Resource Utilization](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-agent/resource-utilization).

For high availability configurations, see [Clustering and High Availability of Netdata Parents](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/observability-centralization-points/metrics-centralization-points/clustering-and-high-availability-of-netdata-parents).

:::

## NETDATA CLOUD ON-PREM

For organizations requiring complete control over their monitoring infrastructure, Netdata Cloud On-Prem provides the full control plane within the datacenter (air-gapped).

Netdata Cloud is a Kubernetes cluster (Kubernetes 1.23+):

| Monitored Nodes | CPU Cores | Memory | Storage | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2,000 nodes | 20 cores | 45 GB | 500 GB | Minimal K8s cluster |
| 10,000 nodes | 100 cores | 200 GB | 2 TB | Multi-node K8s cluster |

:::info

For more information see [Netdata Cloud On-Prem](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud-on-prem) and [Installation Guide](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud-on-prem/installation).

:::

## COST EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

**Infrastructure Savings**
```
Traditional Monitoring: 100% baseline cost
Netdata Efficiency: 20-40% of traditional cost
Savings Realization: 60-80% cost reduction
```

**Operational Savings**
```
Setup Time: 80% reduction (auto-discovery)

# Security & Compliance: Assurance Dashboard

## AUTHENTICATION, AUTHORIZATION, AND ACCOUNTING

**Agent Authorization**
Netdata Agents and Parents are authorized to connect to Netdata Cloud via a process called [claiming](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/connect-agent). This process uses cryptographic certificates to authorize the Agents to connect to Netdata Cloud and can be controlled via configuration management/provisioning tools, or manually.

**User Authentication**
Netdata Cloud supports email authentication, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth, Okta SSO, OpenID Connect (OIDC). For detailed configuration see [Enterprise SSO Authentication](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/authentication-&-authorization/enterprise-sso-authentication).

**Access Control**
Netdata supports automatic mapping of LDAP/AD groups into Netdata roles, using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2. For implementation details see [SCIM Integration](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/authentication-&-authorization/cloud-authentication-&-authorization-integrations/scim).

Netdata Cloud uses spaces and rooms to segment the infrastructure (by geography, type, or any grouping the organization decides). Users gain access to spaces and rooms and, depending on their role, they may have different access to different types of observability data. For comprehensive information see [Role-Based Access model (RBAC)](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-cloud/authentication-&-authorization/role-based-access-model).

## COMPLIANCE STATUS MATRIX

## SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

**Data Sovereignty Controls**
The platform's architecture ensures complete data sovereignty - all metrics and logs remain on customer infrastructure. Only metadata (node names, chart titles, alert configurations) is synchronized to Netdata Cloud, with all data transmission protected by TLS encryption. Air-gapped deployment options are available for maximum security isolation.

**Enterprise Authentication**
Comprehensive SSO integration supports LDAP/AD group mapping through SCIM 2.0, enabling automatic role assignment based on organizational structure. Multi-factor authentication, IP whitelisting, and role-based access control provide granular security controls with comprehensive audit logging.

**Security Operations**
Regular third-party security audits, penetration testing, and an active bug bounty program ensure continuous security improvement. The platform supports configurable data anonymization and network segmentation for sensitive environments.

# Data Retention and Storage

## STORAGE ARCHITECTURE

For metrics, Netdata maintains ingested samples as close to the edge as possible. Netdata Parents receive these data and each parent in a cluster maintains its own copy of them. All metrics are stored in write-once files which are rotated according to configuration (size and/or time based). Each Netdata Agent or Parent maintains by default 3 storage tiers of the same data (high resolution - per second, medium resolution - per minute, low resolution - per hour). All tiers are updated in parallel during ingestion. Users can configure size and time retention per tier. High availability of the data is achieved via streaming (parent-child relationships) and parents clustering.

For detailed information see [Disk Requirements and Retention](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/netdata-agent/resource-utilization/disk-&-retention).

## LOG MANAGEMENT

For logs, Netdata uses standard systemd-journal files (readable with journalctl). Standard systemd-journald practices apply (archiving, backup, centralization, exporting, etc) and Forward Secure Sealing (FSS) is supported.
