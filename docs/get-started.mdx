Netdata is a free and open-source (FOSS) monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from
any physical or virtual system (we call them _nodes_). These metrics are organized in an easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with [Netdata Cloud](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/cloud/cloud.mdx), you can monitor your entire infrastructure in
real time and troubleshoot problems that threaten the health of your nodes.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

To install Netdata in minutes on your platform:

1. Sign up to https://app.netdata.cloud/
2. You will be presented with an empty space, and a prompt to "Connect Nodes" with the install command for each platform
3. Select the platform you want to install Netdata to, copy and paste the script into your node's terminal, and run it

Upon installation completing successfully, you should be able to see the node live in your Netdata Space!

Continue reading for more advanced instructions and installation options.

## Install on Linux with one-line installer 

The **recommended** way to install Netdata on a Linux node (physical, virtual, container, IoT) is our one-line
[kickstart script](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md).  
This script automatically installs dependencies and builds Netdata from its source code.

To install, copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter` to begin the installation process.

:::note
If you plan to also Claim the node to Netdata Cloud, 
make sure to replace `YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN` with the claim token of your space, 
and `YOUR_ROOM_ID` with the ID of the room you are willing to claim to.

## What's next?

To start using Netdata, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either `localhost` or
the hostname/IP address of a remote node.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Dashboard

Learn more about [how the dashboard works](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboard/how-dashboard-works.mdx), or dive directly into the many ways
to [interact with charts](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/dashboard/interact-charts.mdx).

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built-in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Data collection

If Netdata didn't autodetect all the hardware, containers, services, or applications running on your node, you should
learn more about [how data collectors work](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md). If there's a [supported
collector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/collectors/COLLECTORS.md) for metrics you need, [configure the collector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/collect/enable-configure.md)
or read about its requirements to configure your endpoint to publish metrics in the correct format and endpoint.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or 
[enable notifications](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Make your deployment production ready

Both [securing Netdata](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/secure-nodes.md) and [setting up replication](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/streaming/README.md) are strongly recommended.
