# Get started with Netdata

Netdata is a free and open-source (FOSS) monitoring agent that collects thousands of hardware and software metrics from
any physical or virtual system (we call them _nodes_) and organizes them in an easy-to-use and -navigate interface.

Together with [Netdata Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), you can monitor your entire infrastructure in
real time and troubleshoot problems that threaten the health of your nodes before they occur.

Netdata runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT devices. It
runs on Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice platforms (Kubernetes clusters,
Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no `sudo` required.

## Install on Linux with one-line installer (recommended)

The **recommended** way to install Netdata on a Linux node (physical, virtual, container, IoT) is our one-line
[kickstart script](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md). This script automatically installs dependencies and
builds Netdata from its source code.

Copy the script, paste it into your node's terminal, and hit `Enter` to begin the installation process.

troubleshooting with Netdata.

## Run Netdata with Docker

You can also try out Netdata's capabilities in a [Docker container](/packaging/docker/README.md). Copy the following
`docker run` command into your node and hit `Enter` to download and run the container.

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v netdataconfig:/etc/netdata \
  -v netdatalib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v netdatacache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata
```

## What's next?

To start using Netdata, open a browser and navigate to `http://NODE:19999`, replacing `NODE` with either `localhost` or
the hostname/IP address of a remote node.

Where you go from here is based on your use case, immediate needs, and experience with monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Dashboard

Learn more about [how the dashboard works](/docs/dashboard/how-dashboard-works.mdx), or dive directly into the many ways
to [interact with charts](/docs/dashboard/interact-charts.mdx).

### Configuration

Discover the recommended way to [configure Netdata's settings or behavior](/docs/configure/nodes.md) using our built-in
`edit-config` script, then apply that knowledge to mission-critical tweaks, such as [changing how long Netdata stores
metrics](/docs/store/change-metrics-storage.md).

### Data collection

If Netdata didn't autodetect all the hardware, containers, services, or applications running on your node, you should
learn more about [how data collectors work](/docs/collect/how-collectors-work.md). If there's a [supported
collector](/collectors/COLLECTORS.md) for metrics you need, [configure the collector](/docs/collect/enable-configure.md)
or read about its requirements to configure your endpoint to publish metrics in the correct format and endpoint.

### Alarms & notifications

Netdata comes with hundreds of preconfigured alarms, designed by our monitoring gurus in parallel with our open-source
community, but you may want to [edit alarms](/docs/monitor/configure-alarms.md) or [enable
notifications](/docs/monitor/enable-notifications.md) to customize your Netdata experience.

### Need to monitor multiple nodes in one place?

For robust multi-node monitoring from a single interface, consider [Netdata
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud), which streams, aggregates, and visualizes metrics from any number of
nodes. It's all the same out-of-the-box, zero-configuration functionality of the open-source monitoring agent, but for
any number of distributed nodes, _entirely for free_.

There is an alternative for those who aren't interested in using Netdata Cloud, albeit with some required configuration.
Each node can [stream](/streaming/README.md) its metrics to any other node, and the default
[registry](/registry/README.md) is configurable to create a private "network" of Netdata dashboards.
