**What You'll Learn**

How to access the Dynamic Configuration Manager and understand its key features for managing your monitoring infrastructure.

:::

The Dynamic Configuration Manager allows you to configure collectors and alerts directly through the Netdata UI. This feature enables you to:

- **Create, test, and deploy configurations** for one or more nodes directly within the UI
- **Eliminate manual command-line edits and node access**, enhancing your workflow efficiency

:::note

**Cloud Connection and Security**

Your nodes using Dynamic Configuration Manager require a connection to Netdata Cloud. This ensures proper permission handling and data security.

:::

## Collectors

:::tip

**What You'll Learn**

How modules and jobs work together to collect data, and the specific actions you can perform on each.

:::

### Module

A module represents a specific data collector, such as Apache, MySQL, or Redis. Think of modules as templates for data collection.

Each module can have multiple jobs, which are unique configurations of that template tailored to your specific needs.

**Module Management Actions:**

| Action             | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Add job**        | Create new configuration instances (jobs) for a particular module                                                         |
| **Enable/Disable** | Disabling a module deactivates all currently running jobs and prevents any future jobs from being created for that module |

### Job

A job represents a running instance of a module with a specific configuration. Think of it as a customized data collection task based on a module template.

**Job Source Types:**

Every job has a designated "source type" indicating its origin:

| Source Type               | Description                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stock**                 | Pre-installed with Netdata and provides basic data collection for common services |
| **User**                  | Created from user-defined configuration files on the node                         |
| **Discovered**            | Automatically generated by Netdata upon discovering a service running on the node |
| **Dynamic Configuration** | Managed and created through the Dynamic Configuration Manager                     |

**Job Management Actions:**

| Category          | Action             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Configuration** | **Edit**           | Modify an existing job's configuration                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Configuration** | **Test**           | Validate newly created or edited configurations before applying them permanently                                                                                                           |
| **Management**    | **Enable/Disable** | Control the job's activity. Disabling a running job stops data collection                                                                                                                  |
| **Management**    | **Restart**        | Restart a job's data collection, useful if a job encounters a "Failed" state. Upon restart, you'll see a notification with the failure message                                             |
| **Management**    | **Remove**         | Delete a job configuration entirely. Note that you can only remove jobs created through Dynamic Configuration. Other job types originate from files on the node and cannot be deleted here |

:::important

Only jobs created through Dynamic Configuration can be removed. Other job types originate from files on the node and canâ€™t be deleted through the UI.

## Multi-Node Deployment

:::tip

**What You'll Learn**

How to deploy configurations to multiple nodes simultaneously, saving time and ensuring consistency across your infrastructure.

:::

The Dynamic Configuration Manager allows you to submit configurations to multiple nodes with just one click, eliminating the need to configure each node individually.

:::note
For teams using Infrastructure as Code solutions, the Dynamic Configuration Manager allows you to construct and copy configurations easily, integrating them into your IaC workflows. This ensures your configurations are consistent and reproducible across different environments.
:::

### Multi-Node Deployment Process

<details>
<summary><strong>Deploy to Multiple Nodes</strong></summary><br/>

1. Configure your collectors or alerts using any of the methods described above
2. Use the multi-node feature to select your target nodes
3. Submit your configuration, and it will be applied to all selected nodes instantly

<br/>
</details><br/>

:::note

This feature is particularly valuable for managing large infrastructures where manual configuration of individual nodes would be time-consuming and error-prone.

:::

Experience the efficiency and power of the Dynamic Configuration Manager in Netdata today. Whether you're managing a handful of nodes or a vast infrastructure, this feature will make your monitoring and alerting tasks smoother and more intuitive.
