# Backing up a Netdata Agent

> **Note**
>
> Users are responsible for backing up, recovering, and ensuring their data's availability because Netdata stores data locally on each system due to its decentralized architecture.

## Introduction

When planning a Netdata Agent backup, it's essential to recognize the types of data that can be backed up, either individually or collectively:

| Data type           | Description                                          | Location                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agent configuration | Files controlling configuration of the Netdata Agent | [config directory](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md) |
| Metrics             | Database files                                       | /var/cache/netdata                                              |
| Identity            | Claim token, API key and some other files            | /var/lib/netdata                                                |

## Scenarios

### Backing up to restore data in case of a node failure

In this standard scenario, youâ€™re backing up your Netdata Agent in case of a node failure or data corruption so that the metrics and the configuration can be recovered. The purpose is not to backup/restore the application itself.

1. Verify that the directory paths in the table above contain the information you expect.

   > **Note**  
   > The specific paths may vary depending on installation method, Operating System, and whether it is a Docker/Kubernetes deployment.

2. It is recommended that you [stop the Netdata Agent](/docs/netdata-agent/start-stop-restart.md) when backing up the Metrics/database files.  
   Backing up the Agent configuration and Identity folders is straightforward as they shouldnâ€™t be changing very frequently.

3. Using a backup tool such as `tar` you will need to run the backup as _root_ or as the _netdata_ user to access all the files in the directories.

   ```bash
   sudo tar -cvpzf netdata_backup.tar.gz /etc/netdata/ /var/cache/netdata /var/lib/netdata
   ```

   Stopping the Netdata Agent is typically necessary to back up the database files of the Netdata Agent.

If you want to minimize the gap in metrics caused by stopping the Netdata Agent, consider implementing a backup job or script that follows this sequence:

- Backup the Agent configuration Identity directories
- Stop the Netdata service
- Backup up the database files
- Restart the Netdata Agent.

### Restoring Netdata

1. Ensure that the Netdata Agent is installed and is [stopped](/docs/netdata-agent/start-stop-restart.md)

   If you plan to deploy the Agent and restore a backup on top of it, then you might find it helpful to use the [`--dont-start-it`](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart.md#other-options) option upon installation.

   ```bash
   wget -O /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh https://get.netdata.cloud/kickstart.sh && sh /tmp/netdata-kickstart.sh --dont-start-it
   ```

   > **Note**
   > If you are going to restore the database files, then you should first ensure that the Metrics directory is empty.
   >
   > ```bash
    > sudo rm -Rf /var/cache/netdata
    > ```

2. Restore the backup from the archive

    ```bash
    sudo tar -xvpzf /path/to/netdata_backup.tar.gz -C /
    ```

3. [Start the Netdata Agent](/docs/netdata-agent/start-stop-restart.md)
