# Netdata Agent Versions & Platforms

Netdata is evolving rapidly and new features are added at a constant pace. Therefore we have a frequent release cadence to deliver all these features to use as soon as possible.

Netdata Agents are available in 2 versions:

| Release Channel |               Release Frequency               |                 Support Policy & Features                 |             Support Duration             |                              Backwards Compatibility                              |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     Stable      | At most once per month, usually every 45 days | Receiving bug fixes and security updates between releases | Up to the 2nd stable release after them  |     Previous configuration semantics and data are supported by newer releases     |
|     Nightly     |           Every night at 00:00 UTC            |               Latest pre-released features                | Up to the 2nd nightly release after them | Configuration and data of unreleased features may change between nightly releases |

> "Support Duration" defines the time we consider the release as actively used by users in production systems, so that all features of Netdata should be working like the day they were released. However, after the latest release, previous releases stop receiving bug fixes and security updates. All users are advised to update to the latest release to get the latest bug fixes. 

## Binary Distribution Packages

Binary distribution packages are provided by Netdata, via CI integration, for the following platforms and architectures:

> IMPORTANT: Linux distributions frequently provide binary packages of Netdata. However, the packages you will find in the distributions' repositories may be outdated, incomplete, missing significant features or completely broken. We recommend using the packages we provide. 

## Third-party Supported Binary Packages

The following distributions always provide the latest stable version of Netdata:

|  Platform  | Platform Versions |    Released Packages Architecture    |
|:----------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------------:|
| Arch Linux |      Latest       | All the Arch supported architectures |
| MacOS Brew |      Latest       | All the Brew supported architectures |


## Builds from Source

We guarantee Netdata builds from source for the platforms we provide automated binary packages. These platforms are automatically checked via our CI, and fixes are always applied to allow merging new code into the nightly versions.

The following builds from source should usually work, although we don't regularly monitor if there are issues:

|              Platform               |     Platform Versions      |
|:-----------------------------------:|:--------------------------:|
|         Linux Distributions         | Latest unreleased versions |
|       FreeBSD and derivatives       |         13-STABLE          |
|       Gentoo and derivatives        |           Latest           |
|     Arch Linux and derivatives      |      latest from AUR       |
|                MacOS                |         11, 12, 13         |
| Linux under Microsoft Windows (WSL) |           Latest           |

## Static Builds and Unsupported Linux Versions

The static builds of Netdata can be used on any Linux platform of the supported architectures. The only requirement these static builds have is a working Linux kernel, any version. Everything else required for Netdata to run, is inside the package itself. 

Static builds usually miss certain features that require operating-system support and cannot be provided in a generic way. These features include:

- IPMI hardware sensors support
- systemd-journal features
- eBPF related features

When platforms are removed from the [Binary Distribution Packages](/packaging/makeself/README.md) list, they default to install or update Netdata to a static build. This may mean that after platforms become EOL, Netdata on them may lose some of its features. We recommend upgrading the operating system before it becomes EOL, to continue using all the features of Netdata.
