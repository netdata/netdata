# Netdata Cloud Versions

Netdata Cloud is provided in two versions:

- **SaaS**, we run and maintain Netdata Cloud and users use it to complement their observability with the additional features it provides.

- **On Prem**, we provide a licensed copy of the Netdata Cloud software, that users can install and run at their premises. 

The pricing of both versions is similar, with the On-Prem version introducing a monthly fixed-fee for the extra support and packaging required when users are running Netdata Cloud by themselves.

For more information check our [Pricing](https://www.netdata.cloud/pricing/) page.

## SaaS Version
