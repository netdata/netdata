# Enterprise SSO Authentication

Netdata provides you with means to streamline and control how your team connects and authenticates to Netdata Cloud. We provide
 diferent Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations that allow you to connect with the tool that your organization is using to manage your 
 user accounts.
