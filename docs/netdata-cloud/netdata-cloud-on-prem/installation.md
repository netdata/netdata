|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kubernetes**             | - Version 1.23 or newer<br/>- Metrics server installed (for autoscaling)<br/>- Default storage class configured (SSD-based preferred)          |
| **TLS certificate**        | - Single certificate for all endpoints, or separate certificates for frontend, API, and MQTT<br/>- Must be trusted by all connecting entities. |
| **Netdata Cloud Services** | - 4 CPU cores<br/>- 15GiB memory<br/>- Note: Cloud services are ephemeral                                                                      |
| **Third-Party Services**   | - 8 CPU cores<br/>- 14GiB memory<br/>- 160GiB SSD storage for PVCs                                                                             |

> **Note**:
>
> These requirements were tested with 1,000 directly connected nodes.
> Resource needs may vary based on your workload.
> The initial sync of directly connected Agents is the most compute-intensive operation.
> For example, a Postgres instance with 2 vCPU, 8GiB memory, and 1k IOPS can handle 1,000 nodes in a steady environment when adding nodes in batches of 10â€“30.

## Required Components

### Third-Party Services

All components below are included in the `netdata-cloud-dependency` package:

> **Important**:
>
> The provided dependency versions require additional configuration for production use.
> Customers should configure these applications according to their production requirements and policies.

### Installation Tools

- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Helm (version 3.12+ with OCI Configuration)
- Kubectl

## Installation

1. **AWS CLI Configuration**

   Configure AWS credentials using either environment variables:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_secret_id>
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
   ```

   Or through interactive setup:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Configure Helm for ECR Access**

   Generate token for ECR access:

   ```bash
   aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | helm registry login --username AWS --password-stdin 362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
   ```

3. **Pull Required Helm Charts**

   ```bash
   helm pull oci://362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/netdata-cloud-dependency --untar  # Optional
   helm pull oci://362923047827.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/netdata-cloud-onprem --untar
   ```

   The charts will be extracted to your current working directory.

4. **Install Dependencies**

   The `netdata-cloud-dependency` chart installs all required third-party applications. While we provide this for easy setup, **production environments should use their own configured versions of these components**:

    - Configure the installation by editing `values.yaml` in your `netdata-cloud-dependency` chart directory.
    - Install the dependencies:
      ```bash
      cd [your helm chart location]
      helm upgrade --wait --install netdata-cloud-dependency -n netdata-cloud --create-namespace -f values.yaml .
      ```

5. **Install Netdata Cloud On-Prem**

    - Configure the installation by editing `values.yaml` in your `netdata-cloud-onprem` chart directory.
    - Install the application:
      ```bash
      cd [your helm chart location]
      helm upgrade --wait --install netdata-cloud-onprem -n netdata-cloud --create-namespace -f values.yaml .
      ```

   > **Important**:
   >
   > Installation includes resource provisioning with migration services.
   >
   > During the first installation, a `netdata-cloud-common` secret is created containing critical encryption data. This secret persists through reinstalls and should never be deleted, as this will result in data loss.
