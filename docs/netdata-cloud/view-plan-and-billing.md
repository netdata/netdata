     - View invoice history.
   - The **Change plan** button, showing details of your current plan with options to upgrade or cancel.

### Update a Subscription Plan

1. In the **Plan & Billing** tab, click **Change plan** to see:
   - Billing frequency and committed nodes (if applicable).
   - Current billing information, which must be updated through our billing provider's Customer Portal via **Change billing info and payment method** link.
   - Options to enter a promotion code and a breakdown of charges, including subscription total, applicable discounts, credit usage, tax details, and total payable amount.

## FAQ

### What Payment Methods are Accepted?

Netdata accepts most major Credit/Debit Cards and Bank payments through Stripe and AWS, with more options coming soon.

### What Happens if a Renewal Payment Fails?

If payment fails, attempts will be made weekly for 15 days. After three unsuccessful attempts, your Space will switch to the **Community** plan. Notification methods not supported by the Community plan will be disabled after 24 hours.

### Which Currencies Do You Support?

Currently, we accept US Dollars (USD). Plans to accept Euros (EUR) are in the works but without a set timeline.

### Can I Get a Refund?

Refunds are available if you cancel your subscription within 14 days of purchase. Request a refund via [billing@netdata.cloud](mailto:billing@netdata.cloud).

### How Do I Cancel My Paid Plan?

Cancel your plan anytime from the **Plan & Billing** section by selecting 'Cancel Plan' or switching to the **Community** plan.

### How Can I Access My Invoices/Receipts?

Find all your invoicing history under _Billing Options & Invoices_ in the **Plan & Billing** section.

### Why Do I See Two Separate Invoices?

Two invoices are generated per plan purchase or renewal:

- One for recurring fees of the chosen plan.
- Another for monthly "On-Demand - Usage" based on actual usage.

### How is the **Total Before Tax** Value Calculated on Plan Changes?

The total before tax is calculated by:

1. Calculating the residual value from unused time on your current plan.
2. Deducting any applicable discounts.
3. Subtracting credit from your balance, if necessary.
4. Applying tax to the final amount, if positive. Negative results adjust your customer credit balance.

> **Note**
>
> A move to single-invoice billing is expected in the future, although a specific timeline is not set.
