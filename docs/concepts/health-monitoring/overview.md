**********************************************************************

Every Netdata Agent comes with hundreds of pre-installed health alerts designed to notify you when an anomaly or performance issue affects your node or the applications 
it runs. 

Netdata also offers two ways to receive alerts notifications on external platforms. These methods work independently or in parallel, which means you can enable 
both at the same time to send alarm notifications to any number of endpoints.
