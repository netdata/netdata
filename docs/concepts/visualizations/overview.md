**********************************************************************


Because Netdata is a monitoring and _troubleshooting_ platform, dashboards with real-time, meaningful, and context-aware
charts are pivotal in the service we provide to strengthen your monitoring and troubleshooting ability.

As soon as you [install Netdata](/docs/get-started.mdx), it autodetects hardware, OS, containers, services, and
applications running on your node and builds a dashboard on a single, scrollable webpage. This page features hundreds of
charts, which are preconfigured to save you time from learning a query language, all stacked on top of one another. This
vertical rhythm is designed to encourage exploration and help you visually identify connections between the metrics
visualized in different charts.

It's essential to understand the core concepts and features of Netdata's dashboard if you want to maximize your Netdata
experience right after installation, so you can read about visualization components here, and then check out our War
Room and Space structure.
