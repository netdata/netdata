Netdata's distributed monitoring Agent collects thousands of metrics from systems, hardware, and applications with zero
configuration. It runs permanently on all your physical/virtual servers, containers, cloud deployments, and edge/IoT
devices.

You can install Netdata on most Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, and more), container/microservice
platforms (Kubernetes clusters, Docker), and many other operating systems (FreeBSD, macOS), with no sudo required.
