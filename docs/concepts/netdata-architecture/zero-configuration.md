Your Netdata journey doesn't have a cold start. Netdata is preconfigured and capable to autodetect and monitor any well
known application that runs on your system. You just deploy and claim Netdata Agents in your Netdata space, and monitor
them in seconds. Alerts are also preconfigured and fine-tuned, from community members with years of experience in any
component. Notifications about the health of your infrastructure are enabled by default in your Netdata Space.

There might some cases where you might need to configure a step or two but if you specific use our express installation
deployment there are just minor things that you need to tune (like application that need some authentication method to
be monitored by Netdata or tailored made configurations for your case)
