## Alert Detection Types

Netdata supports different ways of triggering alerts:

| Type                | Description                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard**        | Fires when a metric crosses a set value                 |
| **Metric Variance** | Fires based on variation in values over time            |
| **Anomaly Rate**    | Fires when the anomaly rate exceeds a certain threshold |

Choose the type that best suits the behavior you want to monitor.

## Metrics Lookup & Filters

Click **Show advanced** in the Alert Configuration Manager to access these options.

### Metrics Lookup

You can define how Netdata should query the data before triggering an alert:

| Parameter    | Description                                                        |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `method`     | How values are aggregated (`avg`, `min`, `max`, etc.)              |
| `duration`   | Time window used for the check                                     |
| `dimensions` | Which metric dimensions to include                                 |
| `options`    | Modify how values are interpreted (e.g., `percentage`, `absolute`) |

### Filtering Targets

Limit the alert to specific infrastructure components:

- Hosts
- Nodes
- Instances
- Operating systems
- Chart labels

### Formulas

Use a custom formula to manipulate values before comparing against thresholds.

Example:

```txt
(metric1 - metric2) / 100
```

| **Check interval**          | How often the alert check runs (e.g., every 10 seconds)         |
| **Notification delay**      | Delay before sending notifications for state changes            |
| **Repeat notifications**    | How often to resend an alert if the issue persists (Agent only) |
| **Notification recipients** | Define who gets alerted (Agent only)                            |
