# Manage Alert Notification Silencing Rules

From the Cloud interface, you can manage your space's Alert notification silencing rules settings as well as allow users to define their personal ones.

## Prerequisites

To manage **space's Alert notification silencing rule settings**, you will need the following:

- A Netdata Cloud account
- Access to the space as an **administrator** or **manager** (**troubleshooters** can only view space rules)

To manage your **personal Alert notification silencing rule settings**, you will need the following:

- A Netdata Cloud account
- Access to the space with any role except **billing**

### Steps

1. Click on the **Space settings** cog (located above your profile icon).
2. Click on the **Alert & Notification** tab on the left-hand side.
3. Click on the **Notification Silencing Rules** tab.
4. You will be presented with a table of the configured Alert notification silencing rules for:

   - The space (if you aren't an **observer**)
   - Yourself

   You will be able to:

   1. **Add a new** Alert notification silencing rule configuration.
      - Choose if it applies to **All users** or **Myself** (All users is only available for **administrators** and **managers**).
      - You need to provide a name for the configuration so you can easily refer to it.
      - Define criteria for Nodes, to which Rooms will the rule apply, on what Nodes and whether or not it applies to host labels key-value pairs.
      - Define criteria for Alerts, such as Alert name is being targeted and on what Alert context. You can also specify if it will apply to a specific Alert role.
      - Define when it will be applied:
        - Immediately, from now until it is turned off or until a specific duration (start and end date automatically set).
        - Scheduled, you can specify the start and end time for when the rule becomes active and then inactive (time is set according to your browser's local timezone).
      Note: You are only able to add a rule if your space is on a [paid plan](/docs/netdata-cloud/netdata-subscription-plans.md).
   2. **Edit an existing** Alert notification silencing rule configuration. You will be able to change:
      - The name provided for it
      - Who it applies to
      - Selection criteria for Nodes and Alerts
      - When it will be applied
   3. **Enable/Disable** a given Alert notification silencing rule configuration.
      - Use the toggle to enable or disable
   4. **Delete an existing** Alert notification silencing rule.
      - Use the trash icon to delete your configuration

| Space silencing                  | All Rooms          | *        | *                        | *                                                | *             | *                        | *           | This rule silences the entire space, targets all nodes, and for all users. E.g. infrastructure-wide maintenance window.                                                                                                   |

E.g. My team with membership to this room doesn't want to receive notifications for these nodes. |

E.g. node could be going under maintenance.                                                                              |
