# Notifications

Netdata supports two ways to send alert notifications: **from Netdata Cloud** or **from the Netdata Agent**.

You can use either or both depending on how your infrastructure is set up.

Need alerts *fast*?  
Use Cloud for a centralized setup, or Agent for full control on each node.

## Notification Methods

### Netdata Cloud (Centralized)

Netdata Cloud collects alert data from all connected nodes and sends notifications through your configured integrations.

### Netdata Agent (Local)

The Agent sends alerts directly from the node, even if it's offline or not connected to the Cloud.

## Alert Intelligence and Severity Levels

Netdata's alerts are designed to minimize false positives and prevent alarm fatigue.

### Alert Severity Levels

| Level        | Description                                                       | Typical Action                    |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **CLEAR**    | The metric has returned to normal range                           | No action needed                  |
| **WARNING**  | The metric shows concerning behavior that requires attention      | Investigate during business hours |
| **CRITICAL** | The metric indicates a serious problem requiring immediate action | Immediate response required       |

These severity levels help you prioritize your response and can be routed to different notification channels based on urgency.

### Preventing Alert Fatigue

| Feature                   | Benefit                                                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intelligent Defaults**  | Thresholds carefully selected based on real-world experience          |
| **Hysteresis Protection** | Prevents notification floods when metrics fluctuate around thresholds |
| **Notification Delays**   | Configurable delays ensure transient issues don't trigger alerts      |
| **Role-Based Routing**    | Ensures alerts reach only the appropriate stakeholders                |

:::tip

You can configure different notification channels for different severity levels. For example, you can send WARNING alerts to Slack and CRITICAL alerts to PagerDuty.
