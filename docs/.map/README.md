# map.csv

This is the map that Learn uses to properly arrange files.

## custom_edit_url

This column has the link for the github file you want to use, due to having files from other repos apart from netdata/netdata, use full **EDIT** link here. This link will be used when someone presses the edit button on Learn.

## sidebar_Label

The label that the doc will have on the sidebar.

## learn_status

`Published` or `Unpublished`.

## learn_rel_path

This is the path that the file must go to, use uppercase letters, spaces and separate with slashes.

## description

This column is sort of legacy, it is meant to populate a `description` metadata field.
