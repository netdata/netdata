# Using Netdata with AWS Kinesis Data Streams

## Prerequisites

To use AWS Kinesis as a backend AWS SDK for C++ should be
[installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/setup.html) first. `libcrypto`, `libssl`,
and `libcurl` are also required to compile Netdata with Kinesis support enabled. Next, Netdata should be re-installed
from the source. The installer will detect that the required libraries are now available.

If the AWS SDK for C++ is being installed from source, it is useful to set `-DBUILD_ONLY="kinesis"`. Otherwise, the
building process could take a very long time. Take a note, that the default installation path for the libraries is
`/usr/local/lib64`. Many Linux distributions don't include this path as the default one for a library search, so it is
advisable to use the following options to `cmake` while building the AWS SDK:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/usr/lib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/include -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_ONLY=kinesis <aws-sdk-cpp sources>
```

## Configuration

To enable data sending to the kinesis backend set the following options in `netdata.conf`:

```conf
[backend]
    enabled = yes
    type = kinesis
    destination = us-east-1
```

set the `destination` option to an AWS region.

In the Netdata configuration directory run `./edit-config aws_kinesis.conf` and set AWS credentials and stream name:

```yaml
# AWS credentials
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key

# destination stream
stream name = your_stream_name
```

Alternatively, AWS credentials can be set for the `netdata` user using AWS SDK for C++ [standard methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).

A partition key for every record is computed automatically by Netdata with the purpose to distribute records across
available shards evenly.
