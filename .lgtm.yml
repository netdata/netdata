# LGTM does a good job at classifying files, but sometimes it needs some help.
# To classify files which shouldn't be checked we need to define where such
# files are located and manually assign them one of possible categories:
#   docs, generated, library, template, test
# More information can be found in lgtm documentation:
# https://help.semmle.com/lgtm-enterprise/user/help/file-classification.html#built-in-tags
