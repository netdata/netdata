## PHASE 1: Understand the landscape

### Industry, Segment, Customer Targeting

Follow this process:

1. Focus on ICP profiles - not too much bigger or smaller organizations
2. Research their key pain-points, monitoring needs and gaps.
3. Research their technology stacks, compliance requirements, operational needs.
4. Research the monitoring solutions they currently use. What options do they have? Which solution dominates this market?
5. Use multiple research iterations until you have a clear understanding of their bigger pain-points, monitoring needs and the options they have.

### Competitor Targeting

Follow this process:

1. Research their strength and weaknesses. What they are good at, what they are bad at?
2. Research what their customers say. Rate them, how many positive comments, how many negative comments, why positive, why negative.
3. Research what their customers do to work around the problems they have with them - THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEMS problems we need to focus - the effect their weaknesses have on their customers.
4. Use multiple research iterations until you have clear understanding of their strong and weak areas.
5. We are addressing THEIR customers, not our competitor. Even when we talk about a competitor, our focus is THEIR CUSTOMERS.

## PHASE 2: Understand Netdata

1. Research and understand Netdata, under the scope of the specific analysis (customers or competitor target).
2. Identify the pain-points Netdata can completely satisfy and score them: What we can do best, what we lack?

## PHASE 3: Product Positioning

1. Combine Phases 1 and 2
2. Identify the areas we win, turn their pain-points and weaknesses to our benefits when it is justified by our features.
3. Come up with a clear list of "Why Netdata?"
4. Identify the benefits of using Netdata

## PHASE 4: Adapt to our messaging

1. Use the Corduroy messaging for Netdata
2. Adapt the messaging to the specific analysis
   - surface the best of Netdata for this target

## PHASE 5: Your report

   Provide alternative hero-subheading pairs for any sub-segments identified.

3. **Key Value Propositions**

     An imperative hero message for the value prop (imperative = "Get...", "Reduce...", "Brake...", "Eliminate...", "Gain...", "See...", "Advance...", etc - like there is an invisible prefix "With Netdata you..." and then the value prop). The messaging statement must be customized for the specific use cases - not generic.
   - **Public description**
     A few sentences supporting the value proposition.
     This is where features are mentioned.
   - Supporting material of us to understand:
     - why this message among all others
     - direct target pain points/needs addressed
     - how and why Netdata is ideal/unique
     - what is the direct value the customers will get by using Netdata

## General Rules

Be creative. You have all the tools, knowledge and expertise to identify the unique value proposition of Netdata versus competitors, and come up with strong messaging that addresses the key pain-points of the industry/segment/customer, in a simple, direct and aggressive way, backed with facts about Netdata's unique design and architecture. "Simple, direct and aggressive" means to put the benefits for the customer first. The end-user benefit is the KEY MESSAGE to start with.

Your messaging MUST be a "punch on the face" of Datadog, Dynatrace, NewRelic, Grafana, Zabbix, Nagios, CheckMk, SolarWinds: Netdata does the impossible. But respect their work and their contribution to the world. We don't want to be assholes. Focus on the facts, and the effects of their weaknesses on their customers. Win their customers with clear, direct, and aggresive messaging, while respecting the competitors.

You MUST:
- Put the customers FIRST, their needs, their pain-points, the benefits they will get by using Netdata for monitoring their infrastructure.
- Align with the messaging defined by Corduroy for Netdata, adapted to the specific use case / segment / industry / customer.
- Position Netdata as an innovative solution, unlike all others (edge based, distributed, automated, self-managed, easy, simple, holistic, high-fidelity, ML across the board, AI powered troubleshooting and reporting, true real-time, true watchdog, console replacement, operations-first, advanced analytics, extreme cost efficiency by design, extreme scalability, ideal for lean teams) - these must be derived. We don't speak about us, we primarily speak for the customers, their pain-points and their benefits.
- Include clear instructions on how to use the messaging.

You MUST NOT:
- Do NOT position Netdata just as a cheaper alternative. Netdata is the best alternative and cost optimization is one of its core values.
- Do NOT produce a wall of text - this is not a blog.
- Do NOT fabricate Netdata's features - if a crucial feature is missing, mention that "if Netdata had X or Y, messaging could be like W and Z"
- NEVER lose focus on ICP: we target specific size of enterprises - do not give wrong examples.
- NEVER raise legal issues with your claims.
