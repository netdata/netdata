Repository Intelligence Base
CRITICAL: Netdata has 150+ active repos. Precise targeting is essential to avoid timeout/overload.

In this directory you will find all netdata repos.
Each directory is a repo.

For example:
- repo: netdata/cloud-frontend
  on disk: cloud-frontend
- repo: netdata/netdata
  on disk: netdata
- repo: netdata/learn
  on disk: learn

and so on.

   - ML/Anomaly Detection → netdata/src/ml
   - Streaming → netdata/src/streaming
   - Web Server/API → netdata/src/web
   - Configuration → netdata/system or root .conf files
   - MQTT Services → cloud-*-mqtt-* repos
