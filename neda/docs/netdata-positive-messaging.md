## MANDATORY: Positive Messaging

All messaging MUST be positive, forward-looking, and benefits-first.  
Never position Netdata as “good because competitors are bad.”  
Never use negative words or constructions in headings (e.g., “stop,” “don’t,” “avoid,” “no,” “without,” “tax,” “not,” etc).

Headings and titles MUST describe **the user’s benefit**, not the competitor’s weakness and not Netdata’s features in isolation.

### Acceptable Primary Headings (BENEFIT-BASED)

These speak directly to user outcomes. This is the ONLY style allowed for top-level headings.\
Examples:

- See the Full Impact Before It Escalates  
- Feel the Pulse of Your Infrastructure  
- Give Junior Engineers Expert-Level Visibility  
- Edge Intelligence That Thinks For You  
- Slash MTTR by 80%  
- Operate With Confidence at Any Scale  
- Instant Clarity in Any Production Incident  
- Continuous Awareness of What Truly Matters  
- Real-Time Insight That Moves at the Speed of Your Business  
- Unlock Full-Granularity Observability For Every Team  

### Acceptable Secondary Headings (Capabilities / Features)

Still positive, describing what Netdata *does*, not what others fail to do.
Examples:

- Real-Time Insights  
- Single Pane of Glass for Every System  
- Fully Automated Troubleshooting Dashboards  
- Unified Metrics, Logs, and ML Insights  
- Automated Root Cause Analysis  
- Per-Second Visibility Everywhere  
- Always-On Anomaly Detection  
- Edge-Native Architecture  

### Forbidden Headings (NEGATIVE MESSAGING)

Anything that claims Netdata is good because competitors are bad is forbidden.  
If the heading uses ANY negative word, it is automatically unacceptable.

Examples of **unacceptable** framing:

- “Netdata is cheaper than Datadog”  
- “Stop paying egress fees”  
- “Don’t waste time building dashboards”  
- “Avoid centralized monitoring bottlenecks”  
- “Prometheus makes you blind to anomalies”  
- “No more missing metrics”  

These violate the core rule: **never define Netdata through the lens of someone else’s weakness.**

### EXAMPLE: How to Produce Benefit-Based Messaging

1. Fact: Traditional monitoring requires manually building dozens of dashboards.  
2. Fact: Manual dashboards demand skills, discipline, and ongoing upkeep.  
3. Fact: During crises, teams often lack dashboards for the failing component.  
4. Fact: Most incidents result in the creation of new dashboards afterward.  
5. Fact: Netdata provides fully algorithmic dashboards — every metric is always visualized.  
6. Fact: Each Netdata chart is the equivalent of 25–30 Grafana charts.  
7. Fact: Netdata adds correlations, similarity detection, and anomaly context by default.

From these, you derive **only positive outcomes**, such as:

- Immediate clarity during high-stress incidents  
- Reduced cognitive load for engineers  
- Faster onboarding for junior or new team members  
- Reduced toil and maintenance effort  
- Shorter MTTR thanks to always-available data  
- Higher operational maturity and reliability  
- Better team confidence in complex environments  

### Final Rule on Positive Messagging

**THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE HEADINGS ARE POSITIVE, BENEFIT-BASED HEADINGS.**  
Features and capabilities may appear only in secondary text.  
Negative or competitor-framed messaging is strictly forbidden.
