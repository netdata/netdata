Subject: Netdata → High-Fit AWS Accounts \+ POs in Motion

Hi \[AWS Seller/SA Name\],

Netdata is purpose-built for your lean, high-growth accounts that need deep observability — without the cost, complexity, or expertise traditionally required.

We’re already sharing Partner-Originated Opportunities (POs) across mid-market accounts struggling with:

* Slow MTTR and alert fatigue

* Fragmented toolchains and soaring ingestion costs

* Thin teams juggling infra across AWS, hybrid, and edge

Why Netdata wins in these environments:

* AI at the edge — anomaly detection runs locally, not in the cloud

* Per-second resolution — every metric, every container, no sampling

* Instant setup — deploys in seconds, auto-discovers infra, starts scoring anomalies immediately

* Conversational AI — plain-English answers trained on live data, not pre-baked playbooks

We're available via AWS Marketplace and already co-selling with sellers in \[INSERT GEO or SEGMENT\]. Recent POs include \[INSERT LOGOS or VERTICAL\], with fast cycles and strong attach to EC2, EKS, and Outposts.

If you’ve got accounts where observability is a blocker to growth or uptime, we’re ready to partner on deal strategy, overlays, or quick POC.

Let’s sync on where we can drive new workloads together.

Thanks,  
\[Your Name\]
