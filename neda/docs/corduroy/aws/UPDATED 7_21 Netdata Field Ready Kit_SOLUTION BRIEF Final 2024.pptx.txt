Benefits
Per-second visibility without ingesting or sampling data

Netdata captures every metric as it happens and stores it locally. No rollups, gaps, or delayed insights.

Faster incident response without dashboards or tuning

VAI runs on every node and flags real-time anomalies instantly. Teams get plain-English answers, not just alerts.

Predictable pricing that scales with the team

Flat per-node pricing means no surprise bills and no penalties for more data, more nodes, or deeper coverage.

Challenges
Why observability fails small teams in expanding environments. 


Lean infra teams are expected to move fast, but most observability tools weren’t built for them. They rely on sampled data, lagging alerts, and sprawling dashboards. Visibility comes at the cost of complexity: PromQL, manual tuning, and rising bills. Teams burn time jumping between tools instead of fixing issues. AI features promise insight but rarely deliver real help. The result? Slower response, mounting toil, and tools that serve the stack, not the team
Netdata helps lean infra teams detect and resolve issues faster, with lower overhead and fewer tools to manage.

The Netdata Solution
Netdata Observability Platform featuring our AI Co-Engineer. Your teammate that never misses a signal.


Netdata is an observability platform for small DevOps and infrastructure teams. It runs AI directly on each node to detect anomalies in real time with high accuracy. Metrics are captured every second, never sampled or delayed. No tuning. No custom dashboards. Just clear answers to what’s broken, why, and how to fix it. All designed to make our AI Co-Engineer an effective team member that interacts in plain English.

Netdata Observability. Running at the Edge. Real-Time AI Insights and Answers. All on AWS


Case Study: 
Barcelona Metropolitan Transport (TMB)

Challenges
TMB faced the difficulty of monitoring a vast, heterogeneous infrastructure across AWS and on-premises environments. The lack of a unified monitoring tool made it challenging to gain real-time insights, leading to potential downtime and performance issues.
Features
Netdata runs unsupervised ML directly at the edge, not in a central backend, enabling real-time anomaly detection with near-zero false positives, even on busy infrastructure.
