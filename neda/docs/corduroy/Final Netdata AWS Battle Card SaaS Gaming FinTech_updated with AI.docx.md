| High Compute Utilization | Monitoring surge traffic boosts AWS spend |
| Quota Eligible | ISVA-listed for MP \+ ACE quota contribution |

**Proof Points:**
- Used in regional game launches with high concurrency  
- Operates under 1% CPU, 50MB RAM—ideal for latency-sensitive workloads  
- AI Co-Engineer reduces noise and speeds RCA

**Sample Discovery Questions:**
- What broke during your last major update or launch?  
- How do you monitor live ops today across time zones?  
- Are observability costs or dashboards slowing your team down?

## Cloud-Native Fintech
