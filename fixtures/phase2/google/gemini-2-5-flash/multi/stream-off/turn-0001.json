            "text": "**My Reasoning for Handling Phase Two Execution**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user's instruction is a bit tricky.  The core of the problem seems to be the transition between phases and the correct utilization of the `agent__final_report` tool.  Initially, I thought the tool was for the very *end* of the process, but the instructions are pretty clear that I *always* need to provide a tool call, and `agent__final_report` is the only one I have.\n\nHere's how I'm breaking it down:\n\n1.  **Understanding the \"Prompt\":** The current prompt `{\"reason\":\"execute phase two\",\"format\":\"sub-agent\",\"prompt\":\"run\"}` is an instruction. It's a signal that I'm now in phase two.  It's likely an internal communication from some orchestrator or a previous agent.\n\n2.  **The Context:** The previous output was \"phase1 completed, now run agent 2\", which was delivered via `agent__final_report`.  The user seems to be referencing *that* action when they present a new prompt. It almost feels like the user is presenting my *own* last action and then saying \"now what?\". This made me rethink that the `agent__final_report` isn't *only* for the very final step.\n\n3.  **The `agent__final_report` Tool:** I only have this one tool. I need to make a valid call with it, and I'm meant to respond even at this intermediate step. The instruction \"ALWAYS provide your final report to the user\" tells me that I *always* end with this tool. Since it is not a final answer, I need to interpret \"final report\" more broadly.\n\n4.  **The Goal:** My current goal is to \"execute phase two\" and \"run\".  Given that I'm *starting* phase two (or I've *been instructed* to run it), the most logical report is to confirm that I'm now running, or starting phase two. \"phase2 started\" seems like the appropriate thing to report.\n\n5.  **The Confusion with the Example:** The user *showed* me my previous output: `Call agent__final_report with status=\"success\", report_format=\"text\", and content=\"phase1 completed, now run agent 2\".`. This was the output that *preceded* the current instruction. It's easy to get thrown off by this. I need to focus on the *new* instruction and the limited toolset I have.\n\nTherefore, given the constraint of the `agent__final_report` tool, the best action is to use it to report that Phase 2 is starting."
