      In order to integrate your Authorization Server with Netdata the creation of a client is required. Clients are applications and services that can request authentication of a user.
      The access settings for your client are the following:

      | field                    | value                                                 |
      | :--                      | :--                                                   |
      | Root URL                 | `https://app.netdata.cloud/``                           |
      | Home/Initiate login URL  | `https://app.netdata.cloud/api/v2/auth/account/auth-server?iss={your-server-issuer-url}&redirect_uri=https://app.netdata.cloud/sign-in&register_uri=https://app.netdata.cloud/sign-up/verify`  |
      | Redirect URL             | `https://app.netdata.cloud/api/v2/auth/account/auth-server/callback`  |

      ### Netdata Configuration Steps

      2. Click on the **Authentication** tab
