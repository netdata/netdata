            You need to have a Mattermost app on your workspace to receive the webhooks.
            Steps to configure your Mattermost to receive notifications from Netdata:

            1. In Mattermost, go to Product menu > Integrations > Incoming Webhook
              - If you don’t have the Integrations option, incoming webhooks may not be enabled on your Mattermost server or may be disabled for non-admins. They can be enabled by a System Admin from System Console > Integrations > Integration Management. Once incoming webhooks are enabled, continue with the steps below.
            2. Select Add Incoming Webhook and add a name and description for the webhook. The description can be up to 500 characters
            3. Select the channel to receive webhook payloads, then select Add to create the webhook
            4. You will end up with a webhook endpoint that looks like below:
              `https://your-mattermost-server.com/hooks/xxx-generatedkey-xxx`

              - Treat this endpoint as a secret. Anyone who has it will be able to post messages to your Mattermost instance.

            - Notification - you specify which notifications you want to be notified using this configuration: All Alerts and unreachable, All Alerts, Critical only
          * **Integration configuration** are the specific notification integration required settings, which vary by notification method. For webhook:
            - Webhook URL - webhook URL is the url of the service that Netdata will send notifications to. In order to keep the communication secured, we only accept HTTPS urls.
            - Extra headers - these are optional key-value pairs that you can set to be included in the HTTP requests sent to the webhook URL.
            - Authentication Mechanism - Netdata webhook integration supports 3 different authentication mechanisms.
              * Mutual TLS (recommended) - default authentication mechanism used if no other method is selected.
              * Basic - the client sends a request with an Authorization header that includes a base64-encoded string in the format **username:password**. These will settings will be required inputs.
              * Bearer - the client sends a request with an Authorization header that includes a **bearer token**. This setting will be a required input.
