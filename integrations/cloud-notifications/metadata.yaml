            - Token: The Token from the latest **Test notification** received on the webhook endpoint.
              - Click on the **Test** button to receive a notification. Token will be embedded in the payload.

      ### Webhook service

      A webhook service allows your application to receive real-time alerts from Netdata by sending HTTP requests to a specified URL.

      In this section, we'll go over the steps to set up a generic webhook service, including adding headers, and implementing different types of authorization mechanisms.

      #### Netdata webhook integration

      Netdata webhook integration service will send alert and reachability notifications to the destination service as soon as they are detected.

      For alert notifications, the content sent to the destination service contains a JSON object with the following properties:

      | field                             | type                            | description                                                               |
      |:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|

      | context                           | string                          | The chart context.                                                        |
      | space                             | string                          | The space where the node that raised the alert is assigned.               |
      | Rooms                             | object\[object(string,string)\] | Object with list of Rooms names and urls where the node belongs to.       |

      | duration                          | string                          | Duration the alert has been raised.                                       |
      | additional_active_critical_alerts | integer                         | Number of additional critical alerts currently existing on the same node. |

      For reachability notifications, the JSON object will contain the following properties:

      | field            | type    | description                                                                                                                   |
      |:-----------------|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | message          | string  | A summary message of the reachability alert.                                                                                  |
      | url              | string  | Netdata Cloud URL for the host experiencing the reachability alert.                                                           |
      | host             | string  | The hostname experiencing the reachability alert.                                                                             |
      | severity         | string  | Severity for this notification. If host is reachable, severity will be `info`, if host is unreachable, it will be `critical`. |
      | status           | object  | An object with the status information.                                                                                        |
      | status.reachable | boolean | `true` if host is reachable, `false` otherwise                                                                                |
      | status.text      | string  | Can be `reachable` or `unreachable`                                                                                           |

      #### Extra headers

      When setting up a webhook service, the user can specify a set of headers to be included in the HTTP requests sent to the webhook URL.

      By default, the following headers will be sent in the HTTP request

        |  **Header**  | **Value**        |
        |:------------:|------------------|
        | Content-Type | application/json |

      #### Authentication mechanisms

      Netdata webhook integration supports 3 different authentication mechanisms:

      ##### Mutual TLS authentication (recommended)

      In mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication, the client and the server authenticate each other using X.509 certificates. This ensures that the client is connecting to the intended server, and that the server is only accepting connections from authorized clients.

      This is the default authentication mechanism used if no other method is selected.

      To take advantage of mutual TLS, you can configure your server to verify Netdata's client certificate. In order to achieve this, the Netdata client sending the notification supports mutual TLS (mTLS) to identify itself with a client certificate that your server can validate.

      The steps to perform this validation are as follows:

      - Store Netdata CA certificate on a file in your disk. The content of this file should be:

        <details>
          <summary>Netdata CA certificate</summary>

          ```text

      - Enable client certificate validation on the web server that is doing the TLS termination. Below there are examples on how to perform this configuration in `NGINX` and `Apache`.

        **NGINX**

        ```bash
        server {
            listen 443 ssl default_server;

            # ... existing SSL configuration for server authentication ...
            ssl_verify_client on;
            ssl_client_certificate /path/to/Netdata_CA.pem;

            location / {
                if ($ssl_client_s_dn !~ "CN=app.netdata.cloud") {
                    return 403;
                }
                # ... existing location configuration ...
            }
        }
        ```

        **Apache**

        ```bash
        Listen 443
        <VirtualHost *:443>
            # ... existing SSL configuration for server authentication ...
            SSLVerifyClient require
            SSLCACertificateFile "/path/to/Netdata_CA.pem"
        </VirtualHost>
        <Directory /var/www/>
            Require expr "%{SSL_CLIENT_S_DN_CN} == 'app.netdata.cloud'"
            # ... existing directory configuration ...
        </Directory>
        ```

      ##### Basic authentication

      In basic authorization, the client sends a request with an Authorization header that includes a base64-encoded string in the format username:password. The server then uses this information to authenticate the client. If this authentication method is selected, the user can set the user and password that will be used when connecting to the destination service.

      ##### Bearer token authentication

      In bearer token authentication, the client sends a request with an Authorization header that includes a bearer token. The server then uses this token to authenticate the client. Bearer tokens are typically generated by an authentication service, and are passed to the client after a successful authentication. If this method is selected, the user can set the token to be used for connecting to the destination service.
