# RocketChat

From the Netdata Cloud UI, you can manage your space's notification settings and enable the configuration to deliver notifications on RocketChat.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A Netdata Cloud account
- Access to the Netdata Space as an **administrator**
- The Netdata Space needs to be on **Business** plan or higher
- You need to have permissions on Mattermost to add new integrations.
- You need to have a RocketChat app on your workspace to receive the webhooks.

### Mattermost Server Configuration

Steps to configure your RocketChat to receive notifications from Netdata:

1. In RocketChat, Navigate to Administration > Workspace > Integrations.
2. Click **+New** at the top right corner.
3. For more details about each parameter, check [create-a-new-incoming-webhook](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/integrations#create-a-new-incoming-webhook).
4. After configuring integration, click Save.
5. You will end up with a webhook endpoint that looks like below:
  `https://your-server.rocket.chat/hooks/YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
  - Treat this endpoint as a secret. Anyone who has it will be able to post messages to your RocketChat instance.
