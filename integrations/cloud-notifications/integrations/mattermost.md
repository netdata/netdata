# Mattermost

From the Netdata Cloud UI, you can manage your space's notification settings and enable the configuration to deliver notifications on Mattermost.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

- A Netdata Cloud account
- Access to the Netdata Space as an **administrator**
- The Netdata Space needs to be on **Business** plan or higher
- You need to have permissions on Mattermost to add new integrations.
- You need to have a Mattermost app on your workspace to receive the webhooks.

### Mattermost Server Configuration

Steps to configure your Mattermost to receive notifications from Netdata:

1. In Mattermost, go to Product menu > Integrations > Incoming Webhook
  - If you donâ€™t have the Integrations option, incoming webhooks may not be enabled on your Mattermost server or may be disabled for non-admins. They can be enabled by a System Admin from System Console > Integrations > Integration Management. Once incoming webhooks are enabled, continue with the steps below.
2. Select Add Incoming Webhook and add a name and description for the webhook. The description can be up to 500 characters
3. Select the channel to receive webhook payloads, then select Add to create the webhook
4. You will end up with a webhook endpoint that looks like below:
  `https://your-mattermost-server.com/hooks/xxx-generatedkey-xxx`

  - Treat this endpoint as a secret. Anyone who has it will be able to post messages to your Mattermost instance.

For more details please check Mattermost's article [Incoming webhooks for Mattermost](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/).
