## Setup


### Prerequisites

- A Netdata Cloud account
- Access to the Space as an **Admin**
- The Space needs to be on a paid plan
- You need to have permissions on Mattermost to add new integrations.

### Mattermost Server Configuration

1. In Mattermost, go to Product menu > Integrations > Incoming Webhook
    - If you don't have the Integrations option, incoming webhooks may not be enabled on your Mattermost server or may be disabled for non-admins. They can be enabled by a System Admin from System Console > Integrations > Integration Management. Once incoming webhooks are enabled, continue with the steps below.
2. Select Add Incoming Webhook and add a name and description for the webhook.
3. Select the channel to receive webhook payloads, then select Add to create the webhook
4. You will end up with a webhook URL that looks like `https://your-mattermost-server.com/hooks/xxx-generatedkey-xxx`, copy it in order to add it to your integration configuration in the Netdata Cloud UI

For more details please check [Incoming webhooks for Mattermost](https://developers.mattermost.com/integrate/webhooks/incoming/).
