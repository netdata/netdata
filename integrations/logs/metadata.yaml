      The `systemd` journal plugin by Netdata makes viewing, exploring and analyzing `systemd` journal logs simple and efficient.

      It automatically discovers available journal sources, allows advanced filtering, offers interactive visual representations and supports exploring the logs of both individual servers and the logs on infrastructure wide journal centralization servers.

      The plugin automatically detects the available journal sources, based on the journal files available in `/var/log/journal` (persistent logs) and `/run/log/journal` (volatile logs).

    key_features:
      description: |
        - Works on both **individual servers** and **journal centralization servers**.
        - Supports `persistent` and `volatile` journals.
        - Supports `system`, `user`, `namespaces` and `remote` journals.
        - Allows filtering on **any journal field** or **field value**, for any time-frame.
        - Allows **full text search** (`grep`) on all journal fields, for any time-frame.
        - Provides a **histogram** for log entries over time, with a break down per field-value, for any field and any time-frame.
        - Works directly on journal files, without any other third-party components.
        - Supports coloring log entries, the same way `journalctl` does.
        - In PLAY mode provides the same experience as `journalctl -f`, showing new log entries immediately after they are received.

      The Windows Events plugin by Netdata makes viewing, exploring and analyzing Windows Events simple and
      efficient.

      The plugin automatically detects all the available channels and offers a list of "Event Channels".

      By default, it aggregates events from all event channels, providing a unified view of all events.

        - Supports **Windows Event Logs (WEL)**.
        - Supports **Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)** and **TraceLogging (TL)**, when events are routed to Event Log.
        - Allows filtering on all System Events fields.
        - Allows **full text search** (`grep`) on all System and User fields.
        - Provides a **histogram** for log entries over time, with a break down per field-value, for any System Event field and any
          time-frame.
        - Supports coloring log entries based on severity.
        - In PLAY mode it "tails" all the Events, showing new log entries immediately after they are received.
