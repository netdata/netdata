# OpenTelemetry Logs


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/opentelemetry.svg" width="150"/>


The OpenTelemetry log viewer plugin by Netdata makes viewing, exploring and analyzing OpenTelemetry logs simple and efficient.

It works with logs ingested by the `otel.plugin`, which receives OTLP-formatted log data and stores them in
systemd-compatible journal files. The log viewer provides the same powerful exploration interface used for
systemd journal logs.

## Visualization

You can start exploring OpenTelemetry logs on the "Logs" tab of the Netdata UI.


## Key features

- Views logs ingested via **OpenTelemetry OTLP/gRPC** protocol.
- Allows filtering on **any log field** or **field value**, for any time-frame.
- Allows **full text search** (`grep`) on all log fields, for any time-frame.
- Provides a **histogram** for log entries over time, with a break down per field-value, for any field and any time-frame.
- Uses **fast indexed lookups** with pre-built indexes for performance.
- Supports **faceted search** across log fields (severity, hostname, service, etc.).
- In PLAY mode shows new log entries immediately after they are received.

## Setup

## Prerequisites

- A Netdata Cloud account
- The `otel.plugin` configured to ingest OpenTelemetry logs


## Configuration
