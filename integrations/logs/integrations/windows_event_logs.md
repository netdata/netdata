# Windows Event Logs


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/windows.svg" width="150"/>


The Windows Events plugin by Netdata makes viewing, exploring and analyzing Windows Events simple and
efficient.

The plugin automatically detects all the available channels and offers a list of "Event Channels".

By default, it aggregates events from all event channels, providing a unified view of all events.
