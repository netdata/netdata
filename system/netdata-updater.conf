# Configuration for netdata-updater.sh script.
#
# When run non-interactively, the updater script will delay some
# random number of seconds up to NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER before
# actually running the update. The default is 3600 (one hour). Most
# users should not need to change this.
#NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER="3600"

# By default, the updater will update to new major versions without asking
# for user confirmation once we consider them ready for general usage.
#
# You can override this behavior by setting NETDATA_ACCEPT_MAJOR_VERSIONS
# to a space separated list of major versions you are willing to update
# to. Attempts to update to newer major versions not listed in this variable
# will be treated as a fatal error.
#
# An empty value is equivalent to the default behavior.
#
# This only applies to static builds and local builds. If you are using
# our native packages, use your package manager’s existing functionality
# to prevent updates (for example, pinning versions on APT-based systems,
# or the DNF versionlock plugin on RHEL/Fedora).
#
# To lock yourself to a specific major version, set this value to exactly
# that major version number. For example, to stay on version 1.x even
# if 2.x has been released, set this to a value of `1`.
#NETDATA_ACCEPT_MAJOR_VERSIONS=''

# On systems using our native packages, the updater will by default
# attempt to install optional plugin packages that would be installed by
# default on clean installs if those packages are supported on the system.
#
# This behavior can be disabled on a per-package basis using the below
# variables. Setting the variable to a value other than 0 will disable
# the corresponding package (note that you still need to remove the package
# yourself if you don't want it, this just controls whether the updater
# will try to ensure it’s installed or not).
#
# NETDATA_NO_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL controls the `netdata-plugin-systemd-journal`
# package, which provides the systemd journal plugin for Netdata.
#NETDATA_NO_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL="0"
