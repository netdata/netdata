# Configuration for netdata-updater.sh script.
#
# When run non-interactively, the updater script will delay some
# random number of seconds up to NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER before
# actually running the update. The default is 3600 (one
# hour). Most users should not need to change this.
#NETDATA_UPDATER_JITTER="3600"

# On systems using our native packages, the updater will by default
# attempt to install optional plugin packages that would be installed by
# default on clean installs if those packages are supported on the system.
#
# This behavior can be disabled on a per-package basis using the below
# variables. Setting the variable to a value other than 0 will disable
# the corresponding package (note that you still need to remove the package
# yourself if you don0t want it, this just controls whether the updater
# will try to ensure itâ€™s installed or not).
#
# NETDATA_NO_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL controls the `netdata-plugin-systemd-journal`
# package, which provides the systemd journal plugin for Netdata.
#NETDATA_NO_SYSTEMD_JOURNAL="0"
