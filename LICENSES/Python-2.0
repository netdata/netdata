HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
=======================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor of a
language called ABC.  Guido is Python's principal author, although it
includes many contributions from others.  The last version released
from CWI was Python 1.2.  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python
at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.  Python
1.6 was the last of the versions released by CNRI.  In 2000, Guido and
the Python core developement team moved to BeOpen.com to form the
BeOpen PythonLabs team (www.pythonlabs.com).  Python 2.0 is the first
release from PythonLabs.  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who
have worked under Guido's direction to make this release possible.
