# Netdata Agent CLI

The `netdatacli` executable offers a straightforward way to manage the Netdata Agent's operations.

It is located in the same directory as the `netdata` binary.

[^1]: This also clears any active alerts.
[^2]: The Agent may be configured to [automatically clean up ephemeral nodes](/docs/nodes-ephemerality.md#automatically-removing-ephemeral-nodes) when they have been offline for longer than the configured time interval.
[^3]: If a node is represented by multiple Parent Agents in a HA setup, this command must be executed on each Parent Agent.
