        metrics_description: >
          This collector gathers real-time system sensor statistics, 
          including temperature, voltage, current, power, fan speed, energy consumption, and humidity, 
          utilizing the [sensors](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sensors) binary or [sysfs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface).
