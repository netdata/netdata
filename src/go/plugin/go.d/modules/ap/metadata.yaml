        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors various wireless access point metrics like connected clients, bandwidth, packets, transmit issues, signal strength, and bitrate for each device and its associated SSID.
        method_description: >
          This tool uses the `iw` command-line utility to discover nearby access points.
          It starts by running `iw dev`, which provides information about all wireless interfaces. 
          Then, for each interface identified as an access point (type AP), the `iw INTERFACE station dump` command is executed to gather relevant metrics.
