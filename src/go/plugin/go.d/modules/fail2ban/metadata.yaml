        metrics_description: >
          This collector tracks two main metrics for each jail: currently banned IPs and active failure incidents.
          It relies on the [`fail2ban-client`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/fail2ban-client) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.
