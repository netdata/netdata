          Monitors the health of MegaCLI Hardware RAID by tracking the status of RAID adapters, physical drives, and backup batteries in your storage system.
          It relies on the `megacli` CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          Executed commands:
          -  `megacli -LDPDInfo -aAll -NoLog`
          -  `megacli -AdpBbuCmd -aAll -NoLog`
