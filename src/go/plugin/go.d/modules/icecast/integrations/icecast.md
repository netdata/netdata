# Icecast


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/icecast.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: icecast

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors Icecast listener counts.

It uses the Icecast server statistics `status-json.xsl` endpoint to retrieve the metrics.

This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects Icecast instances running on localhost that are listening on port 8000.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Icecast source

These metrics refer to an icecast source.

Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| source | Source name. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| icecast.listeners | listeners | listeners |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Icecast minimum version

Needs at least Icecast version >= 2.4.0


### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/icecast.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/icecast.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.

#### Examples

##### Basic

A basic example configuration.

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8000

```
##### Multi-instance

> **Note**: When you define multiple jobs, their names must be unique.

Collecting metrics from local and remote instances.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `icecast` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m icecast
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `icecast` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep icecast
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep icecast /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep icecast
```
