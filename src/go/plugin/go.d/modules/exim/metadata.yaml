          This collector monitors Exim mail queue.
          It relies on the [`exim`](https://www.exim.org/exim-html-3.20/doc/html/spec_5.html) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.
          
          Executed commands:
          
          - `exim -bpc`
