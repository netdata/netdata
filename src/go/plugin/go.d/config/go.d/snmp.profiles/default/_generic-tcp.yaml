# Generic TCP metrics.

metrics:
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.5.0
    name: tcpActiveOpens
  description: The number of times that TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-SENT state from the CLOSED state. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{connection}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.6.0
    name: tcpPassiveOpens
  description: The number of times TCP connections have made a direct transition to the SYN-RCVD state from the LISTEN state. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{connection}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.7.0
    name: tcpAttemptFails
  description: The number of times that TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the SYN-SENT state or the SYN-RCVD state, plus the number of times that TCP connections have made a direct transition to the LISTEN state from the SYN-RCVD state. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{connection}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.8.0
    name: tcpEstabResets
  description: The number of times that TCP connections have made a direct transition to the CLOSED state from either the ESTABLISHED state or the CLOSE-WAIT state. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{connection}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.9.0
    name: tcpCurrEstab
  description: The number of TCP connections for which the current state is either ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT.
  unit: "{connection}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.17.0
    name: tcpHCInSegs
  description: The total number of segments received, including those received in error. This count includes segments received on currently established connections. This object is the 64-bit equivalent of tcpInSegs. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{segment}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.18.0
    name: tcpHCOutSegs
  description: The total number of segments sent, including those on current connections but excluding those containing only retransmitted octets. This object is the 64-bit equivalent of tcpOutSegs. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{segment}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.12.0
    name: tcpRetransSegs
  description: The total number of segments retransmitted; that is, the number of TCP segments transmitted containing one or more previously transmitted octets. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{segment}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.14.0
    name: tcpInErrs
  description: The total number of segments received in error (e.g., bad TCP checksums). Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
  unit: "{segment}"
- MIB: TCP-MIB
  metric_type: monotonic_count
  symbol:
    OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.15.0
    name: tcpOutRsts
  description: The number of TCP segments sent containing the RST flag. Discontinuities in the value of this counter are indicated via discontinuities in the value of sysUpTime.
