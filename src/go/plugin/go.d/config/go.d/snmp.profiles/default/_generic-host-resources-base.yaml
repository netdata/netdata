  - MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
    symbol:
      OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.5.0
      name: hrSystemNumUsers
      description: The number of user sessions for which this host is storing state information. A session is a collection of processes requiring a single act of user authentication and possibly subject to collective job control.
      family: System/User/Session/Active
      unit: "{session}"
  - MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
    symbol:
      OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.6.0
      name: hrSystemProcesses
      description: The number of process contexts currently loaded or running on this system.
      family: System/Process/Active
      unit: "{process}"
  - MIB: HOST-RESOURCES-MIB
    symbol:
      OID: 1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.7.0
      name: hrSystemMaxProcesses
      description: The maximum number of process contexts this system can support. If there is no fixed maximum, the value should be zero. On systems that have a fixed maximum, this object can help diagnose failures that occur when this maximum is reached.
      family: System/Process/Maximum
      unit: "{process}"
