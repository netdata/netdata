          This collector monitors the activity and performance of YugabyteDB servers.

          It sends HTTP requests to the YugabyteDB [metric endpoints](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/launch-and-manage/monitor-and-alert/metrics/#metric-endpoints).

          It also provides `top-queries` and `running-queries` functions using `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_activity` from YSQL.

          Viewing all running queries via `pg_stat_activity` may require elevated privileges (e.g., `pg_read_all_stats`).

            Retrieves aggregated query statistics from the PostgreSQL-compatible [pg_stat_statements](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/query-1-performance/pg-stat-statements/) extension in YSQL.

            This function queries the `pg_stat_statements` view which tracks execution statistics for all SQL statements executed on the YSQL layer. It provides timing metrics, execution counts, and row statistics for each unique query pattern.

            Use cases:
            - Identify slow queries consuming excessive total execution time
            - Find high-frequency queries that may benefit from optimization
            - Analyze query patterns by database and user

            Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes.
          parameters:
            - id: __sort
              name: Filter By
              description: Select the primary sort column. Options include total time, mean time, max time, calls, and rows. Defaults to total time to focus on most resource-intensive queries.
