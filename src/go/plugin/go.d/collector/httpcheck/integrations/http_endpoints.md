## Overview

This collector monitors HTTP servers availability status and response time.

Possible statuses:

| Status        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| success       | HTTP request completed successfully with a status code matching the configured `status_accepted` range (default: 200), and the response body and headers (if configured) match expectations. |
| timeout       | HTTP request timed out before receiving a response (default: 1 second).                                                                                                                      |
| no_connection | Failed to establish a connection to the target.                                                                                                                                              |
| redirect      | Received a redirect response (3xx status code) while `not_follow_redirects` is configured.                                                                                                   |
| bad_status    | HTTP request completed with a status code outside the configured `status_accepted` range (default: non-200).                                                                                 |
| bad_content   | HTTP request completed successfully but the response body does not match the expected content (when using `response_match`).                                                                 |
| bad_header    | HTTP request completed successfully but response headers do not match the expected values (when using `header_match`).                                                                      |




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per target

The metrics refer to the monitored target.

Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| url | url value that is set in the configuration file. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| httpcheck.response_time | time | ms |
| httpcheck.response_length | length | characters |
| httpcheck.status | success, timeout, redirect, no_connection, bad_content, bad_header, bad_status | boolean |
| httpcheck.in_state | time | boolean |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| [ httpcheck_web_service_up ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | HTTP check endpoint ${label:url} liveness status |
| [ httpcheck_web_service_bad_content ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | Percentage of HTTP responses from ${label:url} with unexpected content in the last 5 minutes |
| [ httpcheck_web_service_bad_status ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | Percentage of HTTP responses from ${label:url} with unexpected status in the last 5 minutes |
| [ httpcheck_web_service_bad_header ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | Percentage of HTTP responses from ${label:url} with unexpected header in the last 5 minutes |
| [ httpcheck_web_service_timeouts ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | Percentage of timed-out HTTP requests to ${label:url} in the last 5 minutes |
| [ httpcheck_web_service_no_connection ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/httpcheck.conf) | httpcheck.status | Percentage of failed HTTP requests to ${label:url} in the last 5 minutes |

#### via UI

The **httpcheck** collector can be configured directly through the Netdata web interface:

1. Go to **Nodes**.
2. Select the node **where you want the httpcheck data-collection job to run** and click the :gear: (**Configure this node**). This node will be responsible for collecting metrics.
3. The **Collectors → Jobs** view opens by default.
4. In the Search box, type _httpcheck_ (or scroll the list) to locate the **httpcheck** collector.
5. Click the **+** next to the **httpcheck** collector to add a new job.
6. Fill in the job fields, then **Test** the configuration and **Submit**.


#### via File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/httpcheck.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the structure is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name1
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/httpcheck.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `httpcheck` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m httpcheck
  ```

  To debug a specific job:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m httpcheck -j jobName
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `httpcheck` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep httpcheck
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep httpcheck /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep httpcheck
```
