# NGINX


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/nginx.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: nginx

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors the activity and performance of NGINX servers, and collects metrics such as the number of connections, their status, and client requests.


It sends HTTP requests to the NGINX location [stub-status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html), which is a built-in location that provides metrics about the NGINX server.


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects NGINX instances running on localhost that are listening on port 80.
On startup, it tries to collect metrics from:

- http://127.0.0.1/basic_status
- http://localhost/stub_status
- http://127.0.0.1/stub_status
- http://127.0.0.1/nginx_status
- http://127.0.0.1/status


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.

## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per NGINX instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| nginx.connections | active | connections |
| nginx.connections_status | reading, writing, idle | connections |
| nginx.connections_accepted_handled | accepted, handled | connections/s |
| nginx.requests | requests | requests/s |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup


You can configure the **nginx** collector in two ways:

| Method                | Best for                                                                                 | How to                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**UI**](#via-ui)     | Fast setup without editing files                                                         | Go to **Nodes → Configure this node → Collectors → Jobs**, search for **nginx**, then click **+** to add a job. |
| [**File**](#via-file) | If you prefer configuring via file, or need to automate deployments (e.g., with Ansible) | Edit `go.d/nginx.conf` and add a job.                                                                        |

### Prerequisites

#### Enable status support

Configure [ngx_http_stub_status_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html).

1. Add a status location

   Create a small server/location that only listens on localhost and exposes `/stub_status`:

   **For local monitoring (default):**

   ```nginx
     # /etc/nginx/conf.d/stub_status.conf
     server {
         listen 127.0.0.1:80;
         server_name localhost 127.0.0.1;

         location = /stub_status {
             stub_status;        # exposes NGINX counters
             access_log off;     # keep logs clean
             allow 127.0.0.1;    # only local access
             deny all;
         }
     }
   ```

    **For remote monitoring:**
    - Change `listen` to bind to an accessible interface (e.g., `listen 80;`)
    - Replace `allow 127.0.0.1;` with your Netdata collector's IP address
    - Keep `deny all;` to block other IPs

2. Reload NGINX and restart Netdata

   ```bash
   nginx -t
   # if OK:
   systemctl reload nginx    # or: nginx -s reload

   systemctl restart netdata
   ```

   After restart, Netdata will auto-detect the endpoint and begin collecting NGINX metrics.

#### via UI

Configure the **nginx** collector from the Netdata web interface:

1. Go to **Nodes**.
2. Select the node **where you want the nginx data-collection job to run** and click the :gear: (**Configure this node**). That node will run the data collection.
3. The **Collectors → Jobs** view opens by default.
4. In the Search box, type _nginx_ (or scroll the list) to locate the **nginx** collector.
5. Click the **+** next to the **nginx** collector to add a new job.
6. Fill in the job fields, then click **Test** to verify the configuration and **Submit** to save.
    - **Test** runs the job with the provided settings and shows whether data can be collected.
    - If it fails, an error message appears with details (for example, connection refused, timeout, or command execution errors), so you can adjust and retest.


#### via File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/nginx.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the structure is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name2
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#edit-configuration-files) script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#locate-your-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/nginx.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `nginx` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m nginx
  ```

  To debug a specific job:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m nginx -j jobName
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `nginx` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep nginx
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep nginx /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep nginx
```
