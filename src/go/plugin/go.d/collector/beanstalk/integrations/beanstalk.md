# Beanstalk


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/beanstalk.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: beanstalk

## Overview

This collector monitors Beanstalk server performance and provides detailed statistics for each tube.


Using the [beanstalkd protocol](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/blob/master/doc/protocol.txt), it communicates with the Beanstalk daemon to gather essential metrics that help understand the server's performance and activity.
Executed commands:

- [stats](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/blob/91c54fc05dc759ef27459ce4383934e1a4f2fb4b/doc/protocol.txt#L553).
- [list-tubes](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/blob/91c54fc05dc759ef27459ce4383934e1a4f2fb4b/doc/protocol.txt#L688).
- [stats-tube](https://github.com/beanstalkd/beanstalkd/blob/91c54fc05dc759ef27459ce4383934e1a4f2fb4b/doc/protocol.txt#L497).


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects Beanstalk instances running on localhost that are listening on port 11300.


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Beanstalk instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| beanstalk.current_jobs | ready, buried, urgent, delayed, reserved | jobs |
| beanstalk.jobs_rate | created | jobs/s |
| beanstalk.jobs_timeouts | timeouts | jobs/s |
| beanstalk.current_tubes | tubes | tubes |
| beanstalk.commands_rate | put, peek, peek-ready, peek-delayed, peek-buried, reserve, reserve-with-timeout, touch, use, watch, ignore, delete, bury, kick, stats, stats-job, stats-tube, list-tubes, list-tube-used, list-tubes-watched, pause-tube | commands/s |
| beanstalk.current_connections | open, producers, workers, waiting | connections |
| beanstalk.connections_rate | created | connections/s |
| beanstalk.binlog_records | written, migrated | records/s |
| beanstalk.cpu_usage | user, system | percent |
| beanstalk.uptime | uptime | seconds |

### Per tube

Metrics related to Beanstalk tubes. This set of metrics is provided for each tube.

Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| tube_name | Tube name. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| beanstalk.tube_current_jobs | ready, buried, urgent, delayed, reserved | jobs |
| beanstalk.tube_jobs_rate | created | jobs/s |
| beanstalk.tube_commands_rate | delete, pause-tube | commands/s |
| beanstalk.tube_current_connections | using, waiting, watching | connections |
| beanstalk.tube_pause_time | since, left | seconds |



## Alerts


The following alerts are available:

| Alert name  | On metric | Description |
|:------------|:----------|:------------|
| [ beanstalk_server_buried_jobs ](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/health/health.d/beanstalkd.conf) | beanstalk.current_jobs | number of buried jobs across all tubes. You need to manually kick them so they can be processed. Presence of buried jobs in a tube does not affect new jobs. |


## Setup


You can configure the **beanstalk** collector in two ways:

| Method                | Best for                                                                                 | How to                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**UI**](#via-ui)     | Fast setup without editing files                                                         | Go to **Nodes → Configure this node → Collectors → Jobs**, search for **beanstalk**, then click **+** to add a job. |
| [**File**](#via-file) | If you prefer configuring via file, or need to automate deployments (e.g., with Ansible) | Edit `go.d/beanstalk.conf` and add a job.                                                                        |

:::important

UI configuration requires paid Netdata Cloud plan. File-based configuration uses the same options and is useful if you prefer configuring via file or need to automate deployments.

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.


<details open><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Data collection frequency. | 1 | no |
| autodetection_retry | Recheck interval in seconds. Zero means no recheck will be scheduled. | 0 | no |
| address | The IP address and port where the Beanstalk service listens for connections. | 127.0.0.1:11300 | yes |
| timeout | Connection, read, and write timeout duration in seconds. The timeout includes name resolution. | 1 | no |
| tube_selector | Specifies a [pattern](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/libnetdata/simple_pattern#readme) for which Beanstalk tubes Netdata will collect statistics. | * | no |

</details>


#### via UI

Configure the **beanstalk** collector from the Netdata web interface:

1. Go to **Nodes**.
2. Select the node **where you want the beanstalk data-collection job to run** and click the :gear: (**Configure this node**). That node will run the data collection.
3. The **Collectors → Jobs** view opens by default.
4. In the Search box, type _beanstalk_ (or scroll the list) to locate the **beanstalk** collector.
5. Click the **+** next to the **beanstalk** collector to add a new job.
6. Fill in the job fields, then click **Test** to verify the configuration and **Submit** to save.
    - **Test** runs the job with the provided settings and shows whether data can be collected.
    - If it fails, an error message appears with details (for example, connection refused, timeout, or command execution errors), so you can adjust and retest.


#### via File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/beanstalk.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the structure is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name2
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/beanstalk.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `beanstalk` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m beanstalk
  ```

  To debug a specific job:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m beanstalk -j jobName
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `beanstalk` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep beanstalk
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep beanstalk /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep beanstalk
```
