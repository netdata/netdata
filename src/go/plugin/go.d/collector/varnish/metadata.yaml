        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors Varnish instances, supporting both the open-source Varnish-Cache and the commercial Varnish-Plus.

          It tracks key performance metrics, along with detailed statistics for Backends (VBE) and Storages (SMF, SMA, MSE).

          It relies on the [`varnishstat`](https://varnish-cache.org/docs/trunk/reference/varnishstat.html) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.
