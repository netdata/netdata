# Dell EMC XtremIO cluster


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/dell.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: prometheus

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Community-blue" />

## Overview

Keep an eye on Dell/EMC XtremIO storage metrics for optimized data management and performance.


Metrics are gathered by periodically sending HTTP requests to [Dell/EMC XtremIO Exporter](https://github.com/cthiel42/prometheus-xtremio-exporter).


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects instances running on the local host by trying to connect to known ports that are [allocated to exporters](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/Default-port-allocations).


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

This collector has built-in grouping logic based on the [type of metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/).

| Metric                    | Chart                                     | Dimension(s)         | Algorithm   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Gauge                     | for each label set                        | one, the metric name | absolute    |
| Counter                   | for each label set                        | one, the metric name | incremental |
| Summary (quantiles)       | for each label set (excluding 'quantile') | for each quantile    | absolute    |
| Summary (sum and count)   | for each label set                        | the metric name      | incremental |
| Histogram (buckets)       | for each label set (excluding 'le')       | for each bucket      | incremental |
| Histogram (sum and count) | for each label set                        | the metric name      | incremental |

Untyped metrics (have no '# TYPE') processing:

- As Counter or Gauge depending on pattern match when 'fallback_type' is used.
- As Counter if it has suffix '_total'.
- As Summary if it has 'quantile' label.
- As Histogram if it has 'le' label.

**The rest are ignored**.



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup


You can configure the **prometheus** collector in two ways:

| Method                | Best for                                                                                 | How to                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**UI**](#via-ui)     | Fast setup without editing files                                                         | Go to **Nodes → Configure this node → Collectors → Jobs**, search for **prometheus**, then click **+** to add a job. |
| [**File**](#via-file) | If you prefer configuring via file, or need to automate deployments (e.g., with Ansible) | Edit `go.d/prometheus.conf` and add a job.                                                                        |

UI configuration requires paid Netdata Cloud plan.

##### selector

This option allows you to filter out unwanted time series. Only metrics matching the selector will be collected.

- Logic: (pattern1 OR pattern2) AND !(pattern3 or pattern4)
- Pattern syntax: [selector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/go/plugin/go.d/pkg/prometheus/selector/README.md).
- Option syntax:

```yaml
selector:
  allow:
    - pattern1
    - pattern2
  deny:
    - pattern3
    - pattern4
```


##### fallback_type

This option allows you to process Untyped metrics as Counter or Gauge instead of ignoring them.

- Metric name pattern syntax: [shell file name pattern](https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match).
- Option syntax:

```yaml
fallback_type:
  counter:
    - metric_name_pattern1
    - metric_name_pattern2
  gauge:
    - metric_name_pattern3
    - metric_name_pattern4
```

#### via UI

Configure the **prometheus** collector from the Netdata web interface:

1. Go to **Nodes**.
2. Select the node **where you want the prometheus data-collection job to run** and click the :gear: (**Configure this node**). That node will run the data collection.
3. The **Collectors → Jobs** view opens by default.
4. In the Search box, type _prometheus_ (or scroll the list) to locate the **prometheus** collector.
5. Click the **+** next to the **prometheus** collector to add a new job.
6. Fill in the job fields, then click **Test** to verify the configuration and **Submit** to save.
    - **Test** runs the job with the provided settings and shows whether data can be collected.
    - If it fails, an error message appears with details (for example, connection refused, timeout, or command execution errors), so you can adjust and retest.


#### via File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/prometheus.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the structure is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name2
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/prometheus.conf
```

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `prometheus` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m prometheus
  ```

  To debug a specific job:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m prometheus -j jobName
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `prometheus` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep prometheus
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep prometheus /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep prometheus
```
