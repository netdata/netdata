        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors the health and performance of Microsoft SQL Server instances.

          It collects metrics from:
          - Performance counters (buffer manager, memory manager, SQL statistics)
          - Dynamic management views (DMVs) for wait statistics, locks, and sessions
          - Per-database transaction and lock statistics
          - SQL Server Agent job status (if permissions allow)
        method_description: |
          It connects to the SQL Server instance via TCP using the go-mssqldb driver and executes queries against:

          - `sys.dm_os_performance_counters` - Performance counter values
          - `sys.dm_exec_sessions` - Connection information
          - `sys.dm_os_wait_stats` - Wait statistics
          - `sys.dm_tran_locks` - Lock information
          - `sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats` - I/O stall (latency) statistics
          - `sys.dm_os_process_memory` - SQL Server process memory
          - `sys.dm_os_sys_memory` - OS physical memory and page file
          - `sys.master_files` - Database file sizes
          - `msdb.dbo.sysjobs` - SQL Agent job status (optional)

            Provides comprehensive SQL query performance metrics from Microsoft SQL Server Query Store.
            This function queries [Query Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/query-store-oltp#overview) runtime statistics to retrieve aggregated runtime statistics for top-performing queries across all monitored databases. It presents results in a sortable, filterable table with extensive performance and resource utilization metrics.
            Use cases:
            - Identify slow or resource-intensive queries consuming excessive CPU time or memory grants
            - Analyze execution time patterns (min, max, standard deviation) for performance tuning
            - Monitor Logical I/O and Physical I/O patterns to identify storage bottlenecks
            - Investigate SQL Server memory pressure through tempdb and memory grant metrics
            Data is sourced from Query Store runtime views, which aggregate query execution statistics. Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes. Columns are dynamically detected based on available Query Store views, with certain metrics only available in SQL Server 2016+.
          parameters:
            - id: __sort
              name: Filter By
              description: Select the primary sort column. The available options depend on your SQL Server version and include metrics like total execution time, number of calls, CPU time, logical I/O, memory grants, and more. Default is Total Time to focus on most resource-intensive queries.

              required: true
              default: totalTime

          returns:
            description: Aggregated query execution statistics from Query Store runtime views, providing comprehensive performance analysis across all monitored databases. Each row represents a unique query pattern (normalized query hash) with cumulative metrics across all its executions.

                description: |
                  Query Store must be enabled on each database you want to monitor for the collector to retrieve top queries performance data.

                  1. Verify Query Store is enabled on your databases:
                     ```sql
                     SELECT name, is_query_store_enabled
                     FROM sys.databases;
                     ```

                  2. Enable Query Store on databases where it is disabled (requires ALTER DATABASE permission):
                     ```sql
                     ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabaseName] SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
                     ```

                     ::: info

                     Note: Enabling Query Store creates system objects and requires appropriate permissions. You may need to enable it on each database of interest individually.
