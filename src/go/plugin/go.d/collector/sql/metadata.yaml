        metrics_description: |
          Metrics and charts for this collector are **entirely defined by your SQL
          configuration**. There is no fixed metric reference: each job can expose
          different metrics depending on its `metrics` and `queries` blocks.

          To see what a specific job collects, open that job’s dashboard in Netdata
          and inspect the charts and dimensions it created.

          :::tip

          To change what is collected, edit the `metrics` (and optional `queries`)
          in the job configuration. After you save the changes, the updated set of
          charts and metrics is reflected in Netdata after the next data collection.

          :::
        method_description: |
          The collector connects to your database using Go’s **database/sql** package
          and the selected driver:

            - `mysql` — MySQL / MariaDB
            - `pgx`   — PostgreSQL
            - `oracle` — Oracle Database
            - `sqlserver` — Microsoft SQL Server / Azure SQL

          For each metric block you define, it executes the SQL query (inline or via
          `query_ref`), reads the result set, and maps it to Netdata charts and
          dimensions.

          ### Result Processing Modes

          | Mode       | How it works                                                                 | Best used when                                      |
          |------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
          | **columns**| Specific numeric columns from each row become dimensions on your charts.     | The result set has stable, known column names.      |
          | **kv**     | One column provides metric names (keys) and another provides their values.   | The set of metrics is dynamic or key–value shaped.  |
      default_behavior:
        auto_detection:
          description: |
            This is a **generic collector** and does **not** perform automatic detection.

            It does not create any jobs on its own — you must configure at least one
            job before it can collect data.
        limits:
          description: |
            There are no built-in limits on the number of queries or rows processed.
            However, each metric block must define at least one chart, and each chart
            must define at least one dimension.

            Keep your queries lightweight and scoped to the data you actually need
            to avoid adding load on the database server.
        performance_impact:
          description: |
            Performance impact depends entirely on the queries you configure and the
            collection frequency (update_every).

            Prefer indexed reads, avoid full table scans or heavy aggregations, and
            consider using database views tailored for monitoring.

          - title: Create a read-only database user
            description: |
              Create a dedicated user for Netdata with read-only privileges on the
              views/tables used in your monitoring queries.

              For example, on a typical RDBMS you would:

              - Create a user.
              - Grant SELECT on system metrics views or monitoring views.

              After creating the user and updating the configuration, restart the
              Netdata Agent with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the appropriate
              method for your system.
          - title: Allow Netdata to connect to the database
            description: |
              Ensure the Netdata host can reach the database via the configured DSN,
              either using:

              - a local UNIX/TCP socket, or
              - a network connection (hostname/IP and port).

              If the database is remote, make sure any firewalls or security groups
              allow connections from the Netdata node.

                PostgreSQL example that exposes a single numeric metric (server uptime in

            - name: KV mode – connection states as key/value pairs
              description: |
                PostgreSQL example that aggregates connection states from
                `pg_stat_activity` and uses kv mode to map each state to a dimension.

                The query:

                ```sql
                SELECT
                  state,
                  count(*) AS cnt
                FROM pg_stat_activity
                GROUP BY state;
                ```

                Example output:

                | state                        | cnt |
                |------------------------------|-----|
                | active                       |   1 |
                | idle                         |  14 |
                | idle in transaction          |   7 |
                | idle in transaction (aborted)|   1 |
                | fastpath function call       |   1 |
                | disabled                     |   1 |

                With `mode: kv`, `state` becomes the **key** and `cnt` the **value**.
                Each distinct `state` value is mapped to a chart dimension via `dims[*].source`.

            - name: Columns mode – map state values to a status metric
              description: |
                Simple PostgreSQL example that turns a boolean-like state into a 0/1
                status metric using `status_when`.

                The query:

                ```sql
                SELECT pg_is_in_recovery();
                ```

                Example output:

                | pg_is_in_recovery |
                |-------------------|
                | f                 |

                This configuration creates a single chart with two status dimensions:
                  - `in_recovery` becomes **1 when the value is `"t"`** and **0 otherwise**.
                  - `not_in_recovery` becomes **1 when the value is `"f"`** and **0 otherwise**.

        Metrics and charts are **defined by your SQL queries and metric blocks** at runtime. They differ by database engine, schema, and configuration, and may include, for example, connection counts, cache hit ratios, row throughput, lock statistics, or custom business KPIs. Use the **Metrics** tab on the job’s dashboard to see exactly what is collected for that job.

        :::tip

         To change what is collected, edit the `metrics` (and optionally `queries`) sections in `go.d/sql.conf` for the corresponding job. Each change is reflected in Netdata charts after the next data collection.
