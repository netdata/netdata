              If using unix socket:
              
              - socket should be readable and writeable by `netdata` user
              
              If using ip socket and TLS is disabled:
              
              - socket should be accessible via network
              
              If TLS is enabled, in addition:
              
              - `control-key-file` should be readable by `netdata` user
              - `control-cert-file` should be readable by `netdata` user
              
              For auto-detection parameters from `unbound.conf`:
              
              - `unbound.conf` should be readable by `netdata` user
              - if you have several configuration files (include feature) all of them should be readable by `netdata` user
