          This collector gathers metrics about client requests, cache hits, and many more, while also providing metrics per each thread pool.

          The [JMX Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) is used to fetch metrics from a Cassandra instance and make them available at an endpoint like `http://127.0.0.1:7072/metrics`.

            description: |
              To configure Cassandra with the [JMX Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter):
              
              > **Note**: paths can differ depends on your setup.
              
              - Download latest [jmx_exporter](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/) jar file
                and install it in a directory where Cassandra can access it.
              - Add
                the [jmx_exporter.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/master/modules/cassandra/jmx_exporter.yaml)
                file to `/etc/cassandra`.
              - Add the following line to `/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh`
                ```
                JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS $JVM_EXTRA_OPTS -javaagent:/opt/jmx_exporter/jmx_exporter.jar=7072:/etc/cassandra/jmx_exporter.yaml
                ```
              - Restart cassandra service.
