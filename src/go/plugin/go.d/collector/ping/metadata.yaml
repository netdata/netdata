          This module measures round-trip time and packet loss by sending ping messages to network hosts.

          There are two operational modes:

          - **Privileged** (send raw ICMP ping, default). Requires the necessary permissions ([CAP_NET_RAW](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) on Linux, `setuid` bit on other systems).

            These permissions are **automatically** set during Netdata installation. However, if you need to set them manually:
              - set `CAP_NET_RAW` (Linux only).
                ```bash
                sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW=eip <INSTALL_PREFIX>/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/go.d.plugin
                ```
              - set `setuid` bit (Other OS).
                ```bash
                sudo chmod 4750 <INSTALL_PREFIX>/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/go.d.plugin
                ```

          - **Unprivileged** (send UDP ping, Linux only). Requires configuring [ping_group_range](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/icmp.7.html):

            This configuration is **not set automatically** and requires manual configuration.

            ```bash
            sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"
            ```

            To persist the change add `net.ipv4.ping_group_range=0 2147483647` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and execute `sudo sysctl -p`.
