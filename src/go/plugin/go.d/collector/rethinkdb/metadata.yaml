        metrics_description: |
          It collects cluster-wide metrics such as server status, client connections, active clients, query rate, and document read/write rates.
          For each server, it offers similar metrics.
        method_description: |
          The data is gathered by querying the stats table in RethinkDB, which stores real-time statistics related to the cluster and its individual servers.
          It also provides a `running-queries` function using the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table (admin-only).

          behavior: |
            Queries rethinkdb.jobs and returns running queries sorted by the selected column.
          performance: |
            Uses system tables and may be expensive on busy clusters.
          security: |
            Query text may contain unmasked literals (potential PII).
          requirements: |
            Requires admin access to rethinkdb.jobs and a working connection.
          availability: |
            Available when the collector is initialized; returns 503 if the collector is still connecting.
