        metrics_description: |
          It collects cluster-wide metrics such as server status, client connections, active clients, query rate, and document read/write rates.
          For each server, it offers similar metrics.
        method_description: |
          The data is gathered by querying the stats table in RethinkDB, which stores real-time statistics related to the cluster and its individual servers.
          It also provides a `running-queries` function using the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table (admin-only).

            Retrieves currently executing queries from the RethinkDB [rethinkdb.jobs](https://rethinkdb.com/docs/system-jobs/) system table.

            This function queries the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table which contains information about background tasks and queries currently running on the cluster. It provides query text, execution duration, client information, and involved servers.

            Use cases:
            - Identify long-running queries that may be blocking resources
            - Monitor active query load across the cluster
            - Investigate client connections generating heavy workloads

            Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes.
          parameters:
            - id: __sort
              name: Filter By
              description: Select the primary sort column. Defaults to duration to focus on longest-running queries.

              default: durationMs
              options: []
          returns:
            description: Currently running queries from the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table. Each row represents a single active query with its execution context.

          performance: |
            Queries the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table:<br/>• Minimal overhead as it reads from an in-memory system table<br/>• Default limit of 500 rows balances completeness with performance<br/>• Returns only currently active queries (no historical data)

                  The user must have admin privileges to query the `rethinkdb.jobs` system table.

                  1. Connect with an admin user account that has access to system tables

                  2. Verify access to `rethinkdb.jobs`:

                     ```javascript
                     r.db('rethinkdb').table('jobs').run(conn)
                     ```

                  - The `rethinkdb.jobs` table is only accessible to admin users
                  - Non-admin users will receive a permission error when attempting to query this table
                  - The collector's regular metrics do not require admin access
