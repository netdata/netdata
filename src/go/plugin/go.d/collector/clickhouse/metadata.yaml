        metrics_description: |
          This collector retrieves performance data from ClickHouse for connections, queries, resources, replication, IO, and data operations (inserts, selects, merges) using HTTP requests and ClickHouse system tables. It monitors your ClickHouse server's health and activity.
        method_description: |
          It sends HTTP requests to the ClickHouse [HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/http), executing SELECT queries to retrieve data from various system tables.
          Specifically, it collects metrics from the following tables:

          - system.metrics
          - system.async_metrics
          - system.events
          - system.disks

            Retrieves and aggregates SQL query performance metrics from ClickHouse [system.query_log](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/system-tables/query_log) table.

            This function queries the `system.query_log` table, which contains information about executed queries including timing, resource usage, and execution statistics. Queries are grouped by their normalized hash (`normalized_query_hash`) to aggregate statistics for identical query patterns with different literal values.

            Use cases:
            - Identify slow queries that consume the most execution time
            - Find frequently executed queries that may benefit from optimization
            - Analyze I/O patterns by examining read/written rows and bytes

            Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes.

                  Ensure the Netdata user can read `system.query_log` on the target ClickHouse instance.

                  1. Verify `query_log` is enabled (enabled by default):

                     ```sql
                     SELECT * FROM system.query_log LIMIT 1;
                     ```

                  2. If using a dedicated monitoring user, grant SELECT access:

                     ```sql
                     GRANT SELECT ON system.query_log TO netdata_user;
