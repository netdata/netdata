        metrics_description: |
          This collector retrieves performance data from ClickHouse for connections, queries, resources, replication, IO, and data operations (inserts, selects, merges) using HTTP requests and ClickHouse system tables. It monitors your ClickHouse server's health and activity.
        method_description: |
          It sends HTTP requests to the ClickHouse [HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/http), executing SELECT queries to retrieve data from various system tables.
          Specifically, it collects metrics from the following tables:

          - system.metrics
          - system.async_metrics
          - system.events
          - system.disks
