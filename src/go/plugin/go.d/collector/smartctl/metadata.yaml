          This collector monitors the health status of storage devices by analyzing S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) counters.
          It relies on the [`smartctl`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/smartctl) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          Executed commands:
          -  `smartctl --json --scan`
          -  `smartctl --json --all {deviceName} --device {deviceType} --nocheck {powerMode}`

            description: |
              Install `smartmontools` version 7.0 or later using your distribution's package manager. Version 7.0 introduced the `--json` output mode, which is required for this collector to function properly.
          - title: For Netdata running in a Docker container
            description: |
              1. **Install smartmontools**.

                  Ensure `smartctl` is available in the container by setting the environment variable `NETDATA_EXTRA_DEB_PACKAGES=smartmontools` when starting the container.

              2. **Provide access to storage devices**.

                  Netdata requires the `SYS_RAWIO` capability and access to the storage devices to run the `smartctl` collector inside a Docker container. Here's how you can achieve this:

                  - `docker run`

                    ```bash
                    docker run --cap-add SYS_RAWIO --device /dev/sda:/dev/sda ...
                    ```

                  - `docker-compose.yml`

                    ```yaml
                    services:
                      netdata:
                        cap_add:
                          - SYS_PTRACE
                          - SYS_ADMIN
                          - SYS_RAWIO # smartctl
                        devices:
                          - "/dev/sda:/dev/sda"
                    ```

                  > **Multiple Devices**: These examples only show mapping of one device (/dev/sda). You'll need to add additional `--device` options (in docker run) or entries in the `devices` list (in docker-compose.yml) for each storage device you want Netdata's smartctl collector to monitor.

                  > **NVMe Devices**: Do not map NVMe devices using this method. Netdata uses a [dedicated collector](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/go/plugin/go.d/collector/nvme#readme) to monitor NVMe devices.
