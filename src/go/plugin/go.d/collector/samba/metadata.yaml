          This collector monitors Samba syscalls and SMB2 calls.
          It relies on the [`smbstatus`](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbstatus.1.html) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          - `smbstatus -P`

              1. **Check for Profiling Support**

                  Before enabling profiling, it's important to verify if `smbd` was compiled with profiling capabilities. Run the following command as root user (using `sudo`) to check:

                  ```bash
                  $ sudo smbd --build-options | grep WITH_PROFILE
                  WITH_PROFILE
                  ```

                  If the command outputs `WITH_PROFILE`, profiling is supported. If not, you'll need to recompile `smbd` with profiling enabled (refer to Samba documentation for specific instructions).

              2. **Enable Profiling**

                  Once you've confirmed profiling support, you can enable it using one of the following methods:

                  - **Command-Line Option**
                      Start smbd with the `-P 1` option when invoking it directly from the command line.
                  - **Configuration File**
                      Modify the `smb.conf` configuration file located at `/etc/samba/smb.conf` (the path might vary slightly depending on your system). Add the following line to the `[global]` section:

                      ```bash
                      smbd profiling level = count
                      ```
              3. **Restart the Samba service**
