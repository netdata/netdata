# VMware vCenter Server


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/vmware.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: vsphere

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors hosts and vms performance statistics from `vCenter` servers.

> **Warning**: The `vsphere` collector cannot re-login and continue collecting metrics after a vCenter reboot.
> go.d.plugin needs to be restarted.




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default `update_every` is 20 seconds, and it doesn't make sense to decrease the value.
**VMware real-time statistics are generated at the 20-second specificity**.

It is likely that 20 seconds is not enough for big installations and the value should be tuned.

To get a better view we recommend running the collector in debug mode and seeing how much time it will take to collect metrics.

</details>

There you can see that discovering took `525.614041ms`, and collecting metrics took `154.77997ms`. Discovering is a separate thread, it doesn't affect collecting.
`update_every` and `timeout` parameters should be adjusted based on these numbers.



## Metrics

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per virtual machine

These metrics refer to the Virtual Machine.

## Setup


You can configure the **vsphere** collector in two ways:

| Method                | Best for                                                                                 | How to                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**UI**](#via-ui)     | Fast setup without editing files                                                         | Go to **Nodes → Configure this node → Collectors → Jobs**, search for **vsphere**, then click **+** to add a job. |
| [**File**](#via-file) | If you prefer configuring via file, or need to automate deployments (e.g., with Ansible) | Edit `go.d/vsphere.conf` and add a job.                                                                        |

:::important

UI configuration requires paid Netdata Cloud plan. File-based configuration uses the same options and is useful if you prefer configuring via file or need to automate deployments.

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.

##### host_include

Metrics of hosts matching the selector will be collected.

- Include pattern syntax: "/Datacenter pattern/Cluster pattern/Host pattern".
- Match pattern syntax: [simple patterns](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/libnetdata/simple_pattern/README.md#simple-patterns).
- Syntax:

  ```yaml
  host_include:
    - '/DC1/*'           # select all hosts from datacenter DC1
    - '/DC2/*/!Host2 *'  # select all hosts from datacenter DC2 except HOST2
    - '/DC3/Cluster3/*'  # select all hosts from datacenter DC3 cluster Cluster3
  ```


##### vm_include

Metrics of VMs matching the selector will be collected.

- Include pattern syntax: "/Datacenter pattern/Cluster pattern/Host pattern/VM pattern".
- Match pattern syntax: [simple patterns](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/libnetdata/simple_pattern/README.md#simple-patterns).
- Syntax:

  ```yaml
  vm_include:
    - '/DC1/*'           # select all VMs from datacenter DC
    - '/DC2/*/*/!VM2 *'  # select all VMs from datacenter DC2 except VM2
    - '/DC3/Cluster3/*'  # select all VMs from datacenter DC3 cluster Cluster3
  ```


</details>


#### via UI

Configure the **vsphere** collector from the Netdata web interface:

1. Go to **Nodes**.
2. Select the node **where you want the vsphere data-collection job to run** and click the :gear: (**Configure this node**). That node will run the data collection.
3. The **Collectors → Jobs** view opens by default.
4. In the Search box, type _vsphere_ (or scroll the list) to locate the **vsphere** collector.
5. Click the **+** next to the **vsphere** collector to add a new job.
6. Fill in the job fields, then click **Test** to verify the configuration and **Submit** to save.
    - **Test** runs the job with the provided settings and shows whether data can be collected.
    - If it fails, an error message appears with details (for example, connection refused, timeout, or command execution errors), so you can adjust and retest.


#### via File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/vsphere.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the structure is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name2
```
You can edit the configuration file using the [`edit-config`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#edit-a-configuration-file-using-edit-config) script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/vsphere.conf
```

##### Examples

###### Basic

A basic example configuration.

```yaml
jobs:
  - name     : vcenter1
    url      : https://203.0.113.1
    username : admin@vsphere.local
    password : somepassword

```
###### Multi-instance

> **Note**: When you define multiple jobs, their names must be unique.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

**Important**: Debug mode is not supported for data collection jobs created via the UI using the Dyncfg feature.

To troubleshoot issues with the `vsphere` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m vsphere
  ```

  To debug a specific job:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m vsphere -j jobName
  ```

### Getting Logs

If you're encountering problems with the `vsphere` collector, follow these steps to retrieve logs and identify potential issues:

- **Run the command** specific to your system (systemd, non-systemd, or Docker container).
- **Examine the output** for any warnings or error messages that might indicate issues.  These messages should provide clues about the root cause of the problem.

#### System with systemd

Use the following command to view logs generated since the last Netdata service restart:

```bash
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata --grep vsphere
```

#### System without systemd

Locate the collector log file, typically at `/var/log/netdata/collector.log`, and use `grep` to filter for collector's name:

```bash
grep vsphere /var/log/netdata/collector.log
```

**Note**: This method shows logs from all restarts. Focus on the **latest entries** for troubleshooting current issues.

#### Docker Container

If your Netdata runs in a Docker container named "netdata" (replace if different), use this command:

```bash
docker logs netdata 2>&1 | grep vsphere
```
