          This collector monitors Pi-hole instances using [Pi-hole API 6.0](https://ftl.pi-hole.net/master/docs/).
          
          It collects DNS query statistics including total queries, blocked domains, query types, resolution status, and client information.
          
          **Note**: This collector is not compatible with Pi-hole versions earlier than v6.0.

          description: |
            By default, it detects Pi-hole instances running on:
            
            - localhost that are listening on port 80
            - within Docker containers

            > **Note that the Pi-hole API 6.0 requires a password**. 
            > While Netdata can automatically detect Pi-hole instances and create data collection jobs, these jobs will fail unless you provide the necessary credentials.
