              This collector is disabled by default. You need to explicitly enable it in [go.d.conf](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/src/go/plugin/go.d/config/go.d.conf).
              
              From the documentation for the OpenVPN Management Interface:
              > Currently, the OpenVPN daemon can at most support a single management client any one time.
              
              It is disabled to not break other tools which use `Management Interface`.
