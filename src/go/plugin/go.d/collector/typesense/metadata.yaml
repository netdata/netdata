        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors the overall health status and performance of your Typesense servers.
          It gathers detailed metrics, including the total number of requests processed, the breakdown of different request types, and the average latency experienced by each request.
        method_description: |
          It gathers metrics by periodically issuing HTTP GET requests to the Typesense server:

          - [/health](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/cluster-operations.html#health) endpoint to check server health.
          - [/stats.json](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/cluster-operations.html#api-stats) endpoint to collect data on requests and latency.

            The collector can automatically detect Typesense instances running on:

            - localhost that are listening on port 8108
            - within Docker containers

            description: |
              While optional, configuring an [API key](https://typesense.org/docs/0.20.0/api/api-keys.html#api-keys) is highly recommended to enable the collector to gather [stats metrics](https://typesense.org/docs/27.0/api/cluster-operations.html#api-stats), including request counts and latency.
              Without an API key, the collector will only collect health status information.

              > If you're running Typesense with the API key provided as a command-line parameter (e.g., `--api-key=XYZ`), Netdata can automatically detect and use this key for queries.
              > In this case, no additional configuration is required.
