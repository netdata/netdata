          This collector monitors the system's clock performance and peers activity status
        method_description: |
          It collects metrics by sending UDP packets to chronyd using the Chrony communication protocol v6.
          Additionally, for data collection jobs that connect to localhost Chrony instances, it collects serverstats metrics (NTP packets, command packets received/dropped) by executing the 'chronyc serverstats' command.
