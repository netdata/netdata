          This collector monitors CockroachDB servers.
        method_description: |
          It scrapes Prometheus metrics from the CockroachDB `/_status/vars` endpoint.

          It also provides `top-queries` and `running-queries` functions using SQL statement statistics (`crdb_internal.cluster_statement_statistics`) and the `SHOW CLUSTER STATEMENTS` command.

        description: |
          The `top-queries` and `running-queries` functions require:

          - A SQL user with `VIEWACTIVITY` or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` privileges.
          - Access to `crdb_internal.cluster_statement_statistics` (may require `SET allow_unsafe_internals = on` on newer versions).

            Retrieves and aggregates SQL statement performance metrics from CockroachDB [crdb_internal.cluster_statement_statistics](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/crdb-internal#cluster_statement_statistics) table.

            This function queries cluster-wide statement statistics grouped by fingerprint (normalized query pattern). It provides aggregated metrics including execution counts, timing breakdowns, and row operation statistics.

            Use cases:
            - Identify slow queries consuming the most total execution time
            - Find frequently executed queries that may benefit from optimization
            - Analyze row read/write patterns to detect inefficient queries

            Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes.
          parameters:
            - id: __sort
              name: Filter By
              description: Select the primary sort column. Options include total time, executions, rows read, rows written, and more. Defaults to total time to focus on most resource-intensive queries.

                  1. Grant `VIEWACTIVITY` (shows full query text) or `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` (masks literals):

                     ```sql

                  2. On newer CockroachDB versions, access to `crdb_internal` may require:

                     ```sql

                  - The collector automatically sets `allow_unsafe_internals = on` for the session when querying `crdb_internal` tables (required on newer versions)
                  - `VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED` replaces literal values with underscores for privacy
                  - Statement statistics are collected by default but can be disabled via cluster settings

            Retrieves currently executing SQL statements across the CockroachDB cluster using [SHOW CLUSTER STATEMENTS](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/show-statements).

            This function provides a real-time snapshot of all active queries across all nodes in the cluster, including their execution phase, duration, and associated metadata.

            Use cases:
            - Identify long-running queries that may be blocking other operations
            - Monitor active workload distribution across the cluster
            - Debug stuck or slow queries in real-time

            Query text is truncated at 4096 characters for display purposes.
          parameters:
            - id: __sort
              name: Filter By
              description: Select the primary sort column. Defaults to elapsed time to show longest-running queries first.
