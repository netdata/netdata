            description: |
              If you are connecting to Memcached via its UNIX socket, ensure that the `netdata` user
              has permission to access it. You can do this by:

              1. Adding the `netdata` user to the `memcache` group.
                 ```bash
                 sudo gpasswd -a netdata memcache
                 ```
              2. Configuring the socket permissions in `/etc/memcached.conf` so the group has access (e.g. `-a 770`).

              **Note**: You may need to restart Memcached after making these changes for them to take effect.
