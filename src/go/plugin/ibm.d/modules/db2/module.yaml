  Monitors IBM DB2 databases using system catalog views and MON_GET_* table
  functions to expose connections, locking, buffer pool efficiency, tablespace
  capacity, and workload performance metrics.

  Detailed charts are opt-in per object family through include/exclude lists.
  Defaults focus on engine activity (system connections, core buffer pools,
  catalog tablespaces). Matching uses glob patterns that can target schema or
  application names, with include rules taking precedence over excludes.

  When the number of matching objects exceeds the configured `max_*` limits,
  the collector publishes deterministic top-N per-instance charts, aggregates
  the remainder under `group="__other__"`, and logs a throttled warning so you
  can refine selectors before cardinality runs away. Group charts (by schema,
  application prefix, or buffer pool family) are always emitted so high-level
  visibility is preserved even when individual instances are trimmed.
