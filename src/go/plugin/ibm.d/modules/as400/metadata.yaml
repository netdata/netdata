          Monitors IBM i (AS/400) systems using SQL services and CL commands to
          expose CPU, memory, storage, job, and subsystem activity.

          **Dependencies:**
          - unixODBC 2.3+ with IBM i Access ODBC driver
          - IBM i 7.2 or later with SQL services enabled

          **Required Libraries:**
          - libodbc.so (provided by unixODBC)
          - IBM i Access Client Solutions
