          Monitors IBM i (AS/400) systems using SQL services and CL commands to
          expose CPU, memory, storage, job, and subsystem activity.

          **Dependencies:**
          - unixODBC 2.3+ with IBM i Access ODBC driver
          - IBM i 7.2 or later with SQL services enabled

          **Required Libraries:**
          - libodbc.so (provided by unixODBC)
          - IBM i Access Client Solutions

          **CPU Collection Methods:**

          The collector uses a hybrid approach for CPU utilization metrics to handle IBM i 7.4+ where
          `AVERAGE_CPU_*` columns were deprecated:

          1. **Primary Method - TOTAL_CPU_TIME**: Uses the monotonic `TOTAL_CPU_TIME` counter from
             `QSYS2.SYSTEM_STATUS()` to calculate CPU utilization via delta-based calculation. This is
             the most accurate method but requires `*JOBCTL` special authority. TOTAL_CPU_TIME is a
             cumulative counter in nanoseconds representing CPU-seconds consumed, naturally in per-core
             scale.

          2. **Fallback Method - ELAPSED_CPU_USED**: If `*JOBCTL` authority is not available, falls back
             to `ELAPSED_CPU_USED` with automatic reset detection. This method tracks when IBM i statistics
             are reset (either manually or via `reset_statistics` configuration) and re-establishes a
             baseline after detecting resets. The values are already in per-core scale.

          3. **Legacy Method - AVERAGE_CPU_UTILIZATION**: For IBM i versions before 7.4, uses the now-
             deprecated `AVERAGE_CPU_UTILIZATION` column, which IBM reports in the same per-core scale.

          The collector automatically selects the appropriate method based on available permissions and
          logs which method is being used.

          **CPU Metric Scale:**

          CPU utilization is reported using the "100% = 1 CPU core" semantic. This means:
          - 100% indicates one CPU core is fully utilized
          - 400% indicates four CPU cores are fully utilized
          - Values are limited to 100% Ã— ConfiguredCPUs, matching the partition's configured capacity

          For shared LPARs, the metrics show absolute CPU consumption in per-core scale, not relative to
          entitled capacity. For example, a shared LPAR entitled to 0.20 cores can show 150% utilization
          when bursting above entitlement.

          **Statistics Reset Behavior:**

          The `reset_statistics` configuration option controls whether the collector resets IBM i system
          statistics on each query via `SYSTEM_STATUS(RESET_STATISTICS=>'YES')`. When enabled:

          - System-level statistics (CPU, memory pools, etc.) are reset after each collection cycle
          - Matches legacy behavior but clears global statistics that other tools may rely on
          - The ELAPSED_CPU_USED fallback method will detect and handle these resets automatically
          - **Caution**: Enabling this affects all users and applications on the IBM i system

          Default: `false` (statistics are not reset, using `RESET_STATISTICS=>'NO'`)

          **Cardinality Management:**

          To prevent performance issues from excessive metric creation, the collector enforces cardinality
          limits on per-instance metrics (disks, subsystems, job queues, message queues, output queues,
          active jobs, network interfaces, HTTP servers).

          **How Limits Work:**
          - The collector counts instances before collecting metrics
          - If count exceeds the configured `max_*` limit, **collection is skipped entirely** for that category
          - The collector logs a warning: `"[category] count (X) exceeds limit (Y), skipping collection"`
          - No metrics are collected for that category until you adjust the configuration

          **Configuration Options:**

          Use **both** limit and selector options together to manage high-cardinality environments:

          | Option | Purpose | Default |
          |--------|---------|---------|
          | `max_disks` | Maximum disk units to monitor | 100 |
          | `max_subsystems` | Maximum subsystems to monitor | 100 |
          | `max_job_queues` | Maximum job queues to monitor | 100 |
          | `max_message_queues` | Maximum message queues to monitor | 100 |
          | `max_output_queues` | Maximum output queues to monitor | 100 |
          | `max_active_jobs` | Maximum active jobs to monitor | 100 |
          | `collect_disks_matching` | Glob pattern to filter disks (e.g., `"001* 002*"`) | `""` (match all) |
          | `collect_subsystems_matching` | Glob pattern to filter subsystems (e.g., `"QINTER QBATCH"`) | `""` (match all) |
          | `collect_job_queues_matching` | Glob pattern to filter job queues (e.g., `"QSYS/*"`) | `""` (match all) |

          **Example Workflow:**

          1. System has 500 disks, collector skips disk metrics (exceeds default limit of 100)
          2. Check logs: `"disk count (500) exceeds limit (100), skipping per-disk metrics"`
          3. Two options:
             - **Option A**: Increase limit: `max_disks: 500` (collects all 500 disks)
             - **Option B**: Use selector: `collect_disks_matching: "00[1-5]*"` (cherry-pick specific disks)

          **Best Practices:**
          - Use selectors to monitor only business-critical objects in large environments
          - Set limits based on your Netdata server's capacity (each instance = multiple charts)
          - Start with defaults and adjust based on actual usage patterns

          Network interface metrics have a fixed internal limit of 50 instances, and HTTP server metrics are capped at 200 instances; these limits are currently not configurable.
