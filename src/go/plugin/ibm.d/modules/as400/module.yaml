  Monitors IBM i (AS/400) systems using SQL services and CL commands to
  expose CPU, memory, storage, job, and subsystem activity.

  **Dependencies:**
  - unixODBC 2.3+ with IBM i Access ODBC driver
  - IBM i 7.2 or later with SQL services enabled

  **Required Libraries:**
  - libodbc.so (provided by unixODBC)
  - IBM i Access Client Solutions

  **CPU Collection Methods:**

  The collector uses a hybrid approach for CPU utilization metrics to handle IBM i 7.4+ where
  `AVERAGE_CPU_*` columns were deprecated:

  1. **Primary Method - TOTAL_CPU_TIME**: Uses the monotonic `TOTAL_CPU_TIME` counter from
     `QSYS2.SYSTEM_STATUS()` to calculate CPU utilization via delta-based calculation. This is
     the most accurate method but requires `*JOBCTL` special authority. TOTAL_CPU_TIME is a
     cumulative counter in nanoseconds representing CPU-seconds consumed, naturally in per-core
     scale.

  2. **Fallback Method - ELAPSED_CPU_USED**: If `*JOBCTL` authority is not available, falls back
     to `ELAPSED_CPU_USED` with automatic reset detection. This method tracks when IBM i statistics
     are reset (either manually or via `reset_statistics` configuration) and re-establishes a
     baseline after detecting resets. The values are already in per-core scale.

  3. **Legacy Method - AVERAGE_CPU_UTILIZATION**: For IBM i versions before 7.4, uses the now-
     deprecated `AVERAGE_CPU_UTILIZATION` column, which IBM reports in the same per-core scale.

  The collector automatically selects the appropriate method based on available permissions and
  logs which method is being used.

  **CPU Metric Scale:**

  CPU utilization is reported using the "100% = 1 CPU core" semantic. This means:
  - 100% indicates one CPU core is fully utilized
  - 400% indicates four CPU cores are fully utilized
  - Values are limited to 100% × ConfiguredCPUs, matching the partition's configured capacity

  For shared LPARs, the metrics show absolute CPU consumption in per-core scale, not relative to
  entitled capacity. For example, a shared LPAR entitled to 0.20 cores can show 150% utilization
  when bursting above entitlement.

  **Statistics Reset Behavior:**

  The `reset_statistics` configuration option controls whether the collector resets IBM i system
  statistics on each query via `SYSTEM_STATUS(RESET_STATISTICS=>'YES')`. When enabled:

  - System-level statistics (CPU, memory pools, etc.) are reset after each collection cycle
  - Matches legacy behavior but clears global statistics that other tools may rely on
  - The ELAPSED_CPU_USED fallback method will detect and handle these resets automatically
  - **Caution**: Enabling this affects all users and applications on the IBM i system

  Default: `false` (statistics are not reset, using `RESET_STATISTICS=>'NO'`)

  **Chart Gaps During Baseline Resets:**

  The `as400.system_activity_cpu_rate` and `as400.system_activity_cpu_utilization` charts rely on
  delta calculations. When the collector detects that IBM i reset these statistics—or when it is
  still establishing the initial baseline—it intentionally skips a sample instead of emitting a zero
  or spike. Netdata renders those skipped samples as small gaps, which is expected behaviour.

  **Cardinality Management:**

  To prevent performance issues from excessive metric creation, the collector enforces cardinality
  limits on per-instance metrics (disks, subsystems, job queues, message queues, output queues,
  active jobs, network interfaces, HTTP servers).

  **How Limits Work:**
  - The collector counts instances before collecting metrics
  - If count exceeds the configured `max_*` limit, **collection is skipped entirely** for that category
  - The collector logs a warning: `"[category] count (X) exceeds limit (Y), skipping collection"`
  - No metrics are collected for that category until you adjust the configuration

  **Configuration Options:**

  Use **both** limit and selector options together to manage high-cardinality environments:

  | Option | Purpose | Default |
  |--------|---------|---------|
  | `max_disks` | Maximum disk units to monitor | 100 |
  | `max_subsystems` | Maximum subsystems to monitor | 100 |
  | `max_job_queues` | Maximum job queues to monitor | 100 |
  | `max_message_queues` | Maximum message queues to monitor | 100 |
  | `max_output_queues` | Maximum output queues to monitor | 100 |
  | `max_active_jobs` | Maximum active jobs to monitor | 100 |
  | `collect_disks_matching` | Glob pattern to filter disks (e.g., `"001* 002*"`) | `""` (match all) |
  | `collect_subsystems_matching` | Glob pattern to filter subsystems (e.g., `"QINTER QBATCH"`) | `""` (match all) |
  | `collect_job_queues_matching` | Glob pattern to filter job queues (e.g., `"QSYS/*"`) | `""` (match all) |

  **Example Workflow:**

  1. System has 500 disks, collector skips disk metrics (exceeds default limit of 100)
  2. Check logs: `"disk count (500) exceeds limit (100), skipping per-disk metrics"`
  3. Two options:
     - **Option A**: Increase limit: `max_disks: 500` (collects all 500 disks)
     - **Option B**: Use selector: `collect_disks_matching: "00[1-5]*"` (cherry-pick specific disks)

  **Best Practices:**
  - Use selectors to monitor only business-critical objects in large environments
  - Set limits based on your Netdata server's capacity (each instance = multiple charts)
  - Start with defaults and adjust based on actual usage patterns

  **IBM i 7.2–7.3 Behavior Note (Message Queues):**

  IBM i 7.4 introduced a message-queue table function that returns only the live backlog. On
  7.2–7.3 systems we fall back to the `QSYS2.MESSAGE_QUEUE_INFO` view, which includes *all*
  recorded messages (even those already processed/cleared from the queue). Aggregations—especially
  `MAX(SEVERITY)`—therefore reflect the historical log, not just the outstanding backlog. This
  behaviour is inherent to the IBM SQL service and can lead to higher-than-expected max severity
  values on pre-7.4 systems.

  Network interface metrics have a fixed internal limit of 50 instances, and HTTP server metrics are capped at 200 instances; these limits are currently not configurable.
