          Monitors the health of Adaptec Hardware RAID by tracking the status of logical and physical devices in your storage system.
          It relies on the `arcconf` CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          Executed commands:
          -  `arcconf GETCONFIG 1 LD`
          -  `arcconf GETCONFIG 1 PD`
