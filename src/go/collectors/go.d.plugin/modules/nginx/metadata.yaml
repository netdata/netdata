        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors the activity and performance of NGINX servers, and collects metrics such as the number of connections, their status, and client requests.
        method_description: |
          It sends HTTP requests to the NGINX location [stub-status](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_stub_status_module.html), which is a built-in location that provides metrics about the NGINX server.

        auto_detection:
          description: |
            By default, it detects NGINX instances running on localhost that are listening on port 80.
            On startup, it tries to collect metrics from:
            
            - http://127.0.0.1/basic_status
            - http://localhost/stub_status
