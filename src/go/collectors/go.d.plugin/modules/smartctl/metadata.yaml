        metrics_description: |
          This collector monitors the health status of storage devices by analyzing S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) counters.
          It relies on the [`smartctl`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/smartctl) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          Executed commands:
          -  `smartctl --json --scan`
          -  `smartctl --json --all {deviceName} --device {deviceType} --nocheck {powerMode}`
