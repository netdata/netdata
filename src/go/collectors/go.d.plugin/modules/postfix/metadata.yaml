          It periodically executes the `postqueue -p` command. The collection interval is set to 10 seconds by default, but this can be configurable.

        description: >
          Postfix has internal access controls for the mail queue. By default, all users can view the queue. If your system has stricter controls, grant the `netdata` user access by adding it to `authorized_mailq_users` in the `/etc/postfix/main.cf `file.
          For more details, refer to the `authorized_mailq_users` setting in the [Postfix documentation](https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html).
