          Monitors the health of StoreCLI Hardware RAID by tracking the status of RAID adapters, physical drives, and backup batteries in your storage system.
          It relies on the [`storcli`](https://docs.broadcom.com/doc/12352476) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

          Executed commands:
          -  `storcli /cALL show all J nolog`
          -  `storcli /cALL/eALL/sALL show all J nolog`
