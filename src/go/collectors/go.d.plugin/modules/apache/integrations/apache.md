# Apache

Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: apache

## Overview

This collector monitors the activity and performance of Apache servers, and collects metrics such as the number of connections, workers, requests and more.


It sends HTTP requests to the Apache location [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html), 
which is a built-in location that provides metrics about the Apache server.


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects Apache instances running on localhost that are listening on port 80.
On startup, it tries to collect metrics from:

- http://localhost/server-status?auto
- http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.

All metrics available only if [ExtendedStatus](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#extendedstatus) is on.


### Per Apache instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit | Basic | Extended |
|:------|:----------|:----|:---:|:---:|
| apache.connections | connections | connections | • | • |
| apache.conns_async | keepalive, closing, writing | connections | • | • |
| apache.workers | idle, busy | workers | • | • |
| apache.scoreboard | waiting, starting, reading, sending, keepalive, dns_lookup, closing, logging, finishing, idle_cleanup, open | connections | • | • |
| apache.requests | requests | requests/s |   | • |
| apache.net | sent | kilobit/s |   | • |
| apache.reqpersec | requests | requests/s |   | • |
| apache.bytespersec | served | KiB/s |   | • |
| apache.bytesperreq | size | KiB |   | • |
| apache.uptime | uptime | seconds |   | • |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Enable Apache status support

- Enable and configure [status_module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html).
- Ensure that you have [ExtendedStatus](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html#troubleshoot) set on (enabled by default since Apache v2.3.6).



### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/apache.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/apache.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `apache` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m apache
  ```
