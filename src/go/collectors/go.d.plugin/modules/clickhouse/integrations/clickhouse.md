# ClickHouse

Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: clickhouse

## Overview

This collector retrieves performance data from ClickHouse for connections, queries, resources, replication, IO, and data operations (inserts, selects, merges) using HTTP requests and ClickHouse system tables. It monitors your ClickHouse server's health and activity.


It sends HTTP requests to the ClickHouse [HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/interfaces/http), executing SELECT queries to retrieve data from various system tables.
Specifically, it collects metrics from the following tables:

- system.metrics
- system.async_metrics
- system.events
- system.disks
- system.parts
- system.processes


This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

By default, it detects ClickHouse instances running on localhost that are listening on port 8123.
On startup, it tries to collect metrics from:

- http://127.0.0.1:8123


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per ClickHouse instance

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

This scope has no labels.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `clickhouse` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m clickhouse
  ```
