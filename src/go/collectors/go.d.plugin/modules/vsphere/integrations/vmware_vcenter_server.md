# VMware vCenter Server


<img src="https://netdata.cloud/img/vmware.svg" width="150"/>


Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: vsphere

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors hosts and vms performance statistics from `vCenter` servers.

> **Warning**: The `vsphere` collector cannot re-login and continue collecting metrics after a vCenter reboot.
> go.d.plugin needs to be restarted.




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default `update_every` is 20 seconds, and it doesn't make sense to decrease the value.
**VMware real-time statistics are generated at the 20-second specificity**.

It is likely that 20 seconds is not enough for big installations and the value should be tuned.

To get a better view we recommend running the collector in debug mode and seeing how much time it will take to collect metrics.

</details>

There you can see that discovering took `525.614041ms`, and collecting metrics took `154.77997ms`. Discovering is a separate thread, it doesn't affect collecting.
`update_every` and `timeout` parameters should be adjusted based on these numbers.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `vsphere` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m vsphere
  ```
