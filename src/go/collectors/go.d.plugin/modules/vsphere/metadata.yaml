            The default `update_every` is 20 seconds, and it doesn't make sense to decrease the value.
            **VMware real-time statistics are generated at the 20-second specificity**.

            It is likely that 20 seconds is not enough for big installations and the value should be tuned.

            To get a better view we recommend running the collector in debug mode and seeing how much time it will take to collect metrics.

            There you can see that discovering took `525.614041ms`, and collecting metrics took `154.77997ms`. Discovering is a separate thread, it doesn't affect collecting.
            `update_every` and `timeout` parameters should be adjusted based on these numbers.
