          This collector monitors the state of Runit services.
          It relies on the [`sv`](https://smarden.org/runit/sv.8) CLI tool but avoids directly executing the binary.
          Instead, it utilizes `ndsudo`, a Netdata helper specifically designed to run privileged commands securely within the Netdata environment.
          This approach eliminates the need to use `sudo`, improving security and potentially simplifying permission management.

            By default, it detects services running in
            $SVDIR or (if $SVDIR is empty) /service directory.

              If you want this collector then you already have runit package installed.
              But if you'll run Netdata in a Docker then you need to also install runit in Netdata container.
