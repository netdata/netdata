          This collector monitors the health of NVMe devices using the command line
          tool [nvme](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#nvme-cli), which can only be run by the root user. It uses `sudo` and
          assumes it is set up so that the netdata user can execute `nvme` as root without a password.

              Add the netdata user to `/etc/sudoers` (use `which nvme` to find the full path to the binary):

              ```bash
              netdata ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nvme
