          This module measures round-tripe time and packet loss by sending ping messages to network hosts.
          
          There are two operational modes:
          
          - privileged (send raw ICMP ping, default). Requires
            CAP_NET_RAW [capability](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) or root privileges:
            > **Note**: set automatically during Netdata installation.
          
            ```bash
            sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW=eip <INSTALL_PREFIX>/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/go.d.plugin
            ```
          
          - unprivileged (send UDP ping, Linux only).
            Requires configuring [ping_group_range](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/icmp.7.html):
          
            ```bash
            sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"
            ```
            To persist the change add `net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and
            execute `sudo sysctl -p`.
