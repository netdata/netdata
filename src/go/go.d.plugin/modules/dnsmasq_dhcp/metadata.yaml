          This collector monitors  Dnsmasq DHCP leases databases, depending on your configuration.
          
          By default, it uses:

          - `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases` to read leases.
          - `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` to detect dhcp-ranges.
          - `/etc/dnsmasq.d` to find additional configurations.
