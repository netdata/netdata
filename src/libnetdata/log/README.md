# Netdata Logging

This document describes how Netdata generates its own logs, not how Netdata manages and queries logs databases.

## Log sources

Netdata supports the following log sources:

1. **daemon**, logs generated by Netdata daemon.
2. **collector**, logs generated by Netdata collectors, including internal and external ones.
3. **access**, API requests received by Netdata
4. **health**, all alert transitions and notifications

## Log outputs

For each log source, Netdata supports the following output methods:

- **off**, to disable this log source
- **journal**, to send the logs to systemd-journal.
- **syslog**, to send the logs to syslog.
- **system**, to send the output to `stderr` or `stdout` depending on the log source.
- **stdout**, to write the logs to Netdata's `stdout`.
- **stderr**, to write the logs to Netdata's `stderr`.
- **filename**, to send the logs to a file.

For `daemon` and `collector` the default is `journal` when systemd-journal is available.
To decide if systemd-journal is available, Netdata checks:

1. `stderr` is connected to systemd-journald
2. `/run/systemd/journal/socket` exists
3. `/host/run/systemd/journal/socket` exists (`/host` is configurable in containers)

If any of the above is detected, Netdata will select `journal` for `daemon` and `collector` sources.

All other sources default to a file.

## Log formats

| Format  | Description                                                                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| journal | journald-specific log format. Automatically selected when logging to systemd-journal.                  |
| logfmt  | logs data as a series of key/value pairs. The default when logging to any output other than `journal`. |
| json    | logs data in JSON format.                                                                              |

## Log levels

Each time Netdata logs, it assigns a priority to the log. It can be one of this (in order of importance):

| Level     | Description                                                                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| emergency | a fatal condition, Netdata will most likely exit immediately after.                    |
| alert     | a very important issue that may affect how Netdata operates.                           |
| critical  | a very important issue the user should know which, Netdata thinks it can survive.      |
| error     | an error condition indicating that Netdata is trying to do something, but it fails.    |
| warning   | something unexpected has happened that may or may not affect the operation of Netdata. |
| notice    | something that does not affect the operation of Netdata, but the user should notice.   |
| info      | the default log level about information the user should know.                          |
| debug     | these are more verbose logs that can be ignored.                                       |

## Logs Configuration

In `netdata.conf`, there are the following settings:

```
[logs]
	# logs to trigger flood protection = 1000
	# logs flood protection period = 60
	# facility = daemon
	# level = info
	# daemon = journal
	# collector = journal
	# access = /var/log/netdata/access.log
	# health = /var/log/netdata/health.log
```

- `logs to trigger flood protection` and `logs flood protection period` enable logs flood protection for `daemon` and `collector` sources. It can also be configured per log source.
- `facility` is used only when Netdata logs to syslog.
- `level` defines the minimum [log level](#log-levels) of logs that will be logged. This setting is applied only to `daemon` and `collector` sources. It can also be configured per source.

### Configuring log sources

Each for the sources (`daemon`, `collector`, `access`, `health`), accepts the following: 

```
source = {FORMAT},level={LEVEL},protection={LOG}/{PERIOD}@{OUTPUT}
```

Where:

- `{FORMAT}`, is one of the [log formats](#log-formats),
- `{LEVEL}`, is the minimum [log level](#log-levels) to be logged,
- `{LOGS}` is the number of `logs to trigger flood protection` configured per output,
- `{PERIOD}` is the equivalent of `logs flood protection period` configured per output,
- `{OUTPUT}` is one of the `[log outputs](#log-outputs),

All parameters can be omitted, except `{OUTPUT}`. If `{OUTPUT}` is the only given parameter, `@` can be omitted.

### Logs rotation

Netdata comes with `logrotate` configuration to rotate its log files periodically.

The default is usually found in `/etc/logrotate.d/netdata`.

Sending a `SIGHUP` to Netdata, will instruct it to re-open all its log files.

### Message IDs

Netdata assigns specific message IDs to certain events:

- `ed4cdb8f1beb4ad3b57cb3cae2d162fa` when a Netdata child connects to this Netdata
- `6e2e3839067648968b646045dbf28d66` when this Netdata connects to a Netdata parent
- `9ce0cb58ab8b44df82c4bf1ad9ee22de` when alerts change state
- `6db0018e83e34320ae2a659d78019fb7` when notifications are sent

You can view these events using the Netdata systemd-journal.plugin at the `MESSAGE_ID` filter,
or using `journalctl` like this:

```bash
# query children connection
journalctl MESSAGE_ID=ed4cdb8f1beb4ad3b57cb3cae2d162fa

# query parent connection
journalctl MESSAGE_ID=6e2e3839067648968b646045dbf28d66

# query alert transitions
journalctl MESSAGE_ID=9ce0cb58ab8b44df82c4bf1ad9ee22de

# query alert notifications
journalctl MESSAGE_ID=6db0018e83e34320ae2a659d78019fb7
```

## Using journalctl to query Netdata logs

The Netdata service's processes execute within the `netdata` journal namespace. To view the Netdata logs, you should
specify the `--namespace=netdata` option.

```bash
# Netdata logs since the last time the service was started
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show --value --property=InvocationID netdata)" --namespace=netdata

# All netdata logs, the oldest entries are displayed first  
journalctl -u netdata --namespace=netdata

# All netdata logs, the newest entries are displayed first  
journalctl -u netdata --namespace=netdata -r
```
