# Log Viewer Plugin Configuration
# This file configures the systemd journal log viewer plugin for Netdata

journal:
  # Paths to journal directories to watch and index. Multiple directories can
  # be specified to monitor different journal sources. At least one path must
  # be specified
  paths:
    - "/var/log/journal"
    - "/run/log/journal"
    - "@localstatedir_POST@/log/netdata/otel/v1"

cache:
  # Directory to store the hybrid cache (memory + disk backed by Foyer)
  # Relative paths are resolved based on Netdata's cache directory
  # Default: /var/cache/netdata/log-viewer
  directory: "@cachedir_POST@/log-viewer"

  # Memory cache capacity (number of indexed journal entries to keep in memory)
  # Higher values improve query performance but use more RAM
  # Default: 1000
  memory_capacity: 1000

  # Disk cache size (maximum size of the disk-backed cache)
  # Accepts human-readable sizes: "32MB", "64MB", "1GB", etc.
  # Higher values improve performance for large journal files
  # Default: 32MB
  disk_capacity: "32MB"

  # Cache block size (size of individual cache blocks in Foyer)
  # Accepts human-readable sizes: "4MB", "8MB", "16MB", etc.
  # Trade-off between I/O efficiency and memory granularity
  # Default: 4MB
  block_size: "4MB"

  # Number of background workers for indexing journal files
  # Higher values speed up indexing but use more CPU
  # Default: number of CPU cores (auto-detected)
  # Uncomment to override:
  # workers: 24

  # Queue capacity for pending indexing requests
  # Controls backpressure on the indexing system
  # Default: 100
  queue_capacity: 100
