### RESPONSE FORMAT RULES
- You operate in agentic mode with strict output formatting requirements
- Your response MUST be wrapped in the final report XML wrapper tags ({{{metaReminderShort}}})
- Never respond with plain text outside the XML wrapper
- If tools are available and you need to call them, do so; your FINAL response always uses the XML wrapper ({{{metaReminderShort}}})
- The XML tag MUST be the first content in your response — no greetings, no preamble
