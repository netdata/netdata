 *
 *	@mainpage	Lightning Memory-Mapped Database Manager (LMDB)
 *
 *	@section intro_sec Introduction
 *	LMDB is a Btree-based database management library modeled loosely on the
 *	BerkeleyDB API, but much simplified. The entire database is exposed
 *	in a memory map, and all data fetches return data directly
 *	from the mapped memory, so no malloc's or memcpy's occur during
 *	data fetches. As such, the library is extremely simple because it
 *	requires no page caching layer of its own, and it is extremely high
 *	performance and memory-efficient. It is also fully transactional with
 *	full ACID semantics, and when the memory map is read-only, the
 *	database integrity cannot be corrupted by stray pointer writes from
 *	application code.
 *
 *	The library is fully thread-aware and supports concurrent read/write
 *	access from multiple processes and threads. Data pages use a copy-on-
 *	write strategy so no active data pages are ever overwritten, which
 *	also provides resistance to corruption and eliminates the need of any
 *	special recovery procedures after a system crash. Writes are fully
 *	serialized; only one write transaction may be active at a time, which
 *	guarantees that writers can never deadlock. The database structure is
 *	multi-versioned so readers run with no locks; writers cannot block
 *	readers, and readers don't block writers.
 *
 *	Unlike other well-known database mechanisms which use either write-ahead
 *	transaction logs or append-only data writes, LMDB requires no maintenance
 *	during operation. Both write-ahead loggers and append-only databases
 *	require periodic checkpointing and/or compaction of their log or database
 *	files otherwise they grow without bound. LMDB tracks free pages within
 *	the database and re-uses them for new write operations, so the database
 *	size does not grow without bound in normal use.
 *
 *	The memory map can be used as a read-only or read-write map. It is
 *	read-only by default as this provides total immunity to corruption.
 *	Using read-write mode offers much higher write performance, but adds
 *	the possibility for stray application writes thru pointers to silently
 *	corrupt the database. Of course if your application code is known to
 *	be bug-free (...) then this is not an issue.
 *
 *	If this is your first time using a transactional embedded key/value
 *	store, you may find the \ref starting page to be helpful.
 *
 *	@section caveats_sec Caveats
 *	Troubleshooting the lock file, plus semaphores on BSD systems:
 *
 *	- A broken lockfile can cause sync issues.
 *	  Stale reader transactions left behind by an aborted program
 *	  cause further writes to grow the database quickly, and
 *	  stale locks can block further operation.
 *
 *	  Fix: Check for stale readers periodically, using the
 *	  #mdb_reader_check function or the \ref mdb_stat_1 "mdb_stat" tool.
 *	  Stale writers will be cleared automatically on some systems:
 *	  - Windows - automatic
 *	  - Linux, systems using POSIX mutexes with Robust option - automatic
 *	  - not on BSD, systems using POSIX semaphores.
 *	  Otherwise just make all programs using the database close it;
 *	  the lockfile is always reset on first open of the environment.
 *
 *	- On BSD systems or others configured with MDB_USE_POSIX_SEM,
 *	  startup can fail due to semaphores owned by another userid.
 *
 *	  Fix: Open and close the database as the user which owns the
 *	  semaphores (likely last user) or as root, while no other
 *	  process is using the database.
 *
 *	Restrictions/caveats (in addition to those listed for some functions):
 *
 *	- Only the database owner should normally use the database on
 *	  BSD systems or when otherwise configured with MDB_USE_POSIX_SEM.
 *	  Multiple users can cause startup to fail later, as noted above.
 *
 *	- There is normally no pure read-only mode, since readers need write
 *	  access to locks and lock file. Exceptions: On read-only filesystems
 *	  or with the #MDB_NOLOCK flag described under #mdb_env_open().
 *
 *	- An LMDB configuration will often reserve considerable \b unused
 *	  memory address space and maybe file size for future growth.
 *	  This does not use actual memory or disk space, but users may need
 *	  to understand the difference so they won't be scared off.
 *
 *	- By default, in versions before 0.9.10, unused portions of the data
 *	  file might receive garbage data from memory freed by other code.
 *	  (This does not happen when using the #MDB_WRITEMAP flag.) As of
 *	  0.9.10 the default behavior is to initialize such memory before
 *	  writing to the data file. Since there may be a slight performance
 *	  cost due to this initialization, applications may disable it using
 *	  the #MDB_NOMEMINIT flag. Applications handling sensitive data
 *	  which must not be written should not use this flag. This flag is
 *	  irrelevant when using #MDB_WRITEMAP.
 *
 *	- A thread can only use one transaction at a time, plus any child
 *	  transactions.  Each transaction belongs to one thread.  See below.
 *	  The #MDB_NOTLS flag changes this for read-only transactions.
 *
 *	- Use an MDB_env* in the process which opened it, not after fork().
 *
 *	- Do not have open an LMDB database twice in the same process at
 *	  the same time.  Not even from a plain open() call - close()ing it
 *	  breaks fcntl() advisory locking.  (It is OK to reopen it after
 *	  fork() - exec*(), since the lockfile has FD_CLOEXEC set.)
 *
 *	- Avoid long-lived transactions.  Read transactions prevent
 *	  reuse of pages freed by newer write transactions, thus the
 *	  database can grow quickly.  Write transactions prevent
 *	  other write transactions, since writes are serialized.
 *
 *	- Avoid suspending a process with active transactions.  These
 *	  would then be "long-lived" as above.  Also read transactions
 *	  suspended when writers commit could sometimes see wrong data.
 *
 *	...when several processes can use a database concurrently:
 *
 *	- Avoid aborting a process with an active transaction.
 *	  The transaction becomes "long-lived" as above until a check
 *	  for stale readers is performed or the lockfile is reset,
 *	  since the process may not remove it from the lockfile.
 *
 *	  This does not apply to write transactions if the system clears
 *	  stale writers, see above.
 *
 *	- If you do that anyway, do a periodic check for stale readers. Or
 *	  close the environment once in a while, so the lockfile can get reset.
 *
 *	- Do not use LMDB databases on remote filesystems, even between
 *	  processes on the same host.  This breaks flock() on some OSes,
 *	  possibly memory map sync, and certainly sync between programs
 *	  on different hosts.
 *
 *	- Opening a database can fail if another process is opening or
 *	  closing it at exactly the same time.

	 * <ul>
	 *	<li>#MDB_FIXEDMAP
	 *      use a fixed address for the mmap region. This flag must be specified
	 *      when creating the environment, and is stored persistently in the environment.
	 *		If successful, the memory map will always reside at the same virtual address
	 *		and pointers used to reference data items in the database will be constant
	 *		across multiple invocations. This option may not always work, depending on
	 *		how the operating system has allocated memory to shared libraries and other uses.
	 *		The feature is highly experimental.
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOSUBDIR
	 *		By default, LMDB creates its environment in a directory whose
	 *		pathname is given in \b path, and creates its data and lock files
	 *		under that directory. With this option, \b path is used as-is for
	 *		the database main data file. The database lock file is the \b path
	 *		with "-lock" appended.
	 *	<li>#MDB_RDONLY
	 *		Open the environment in read-only mode. No write operations will be
	 *		allowed. LMDB will still modify the lock file - except on read-only
	 *		filesystems, where LMDB does not use locks.
	 *	<li>#MDB_WRITEMAP
	 *		Use a writeable memory map unless MDB_RDONLY is set. This uses
	 *		fewer mallocs but loses protection from application bugs
	 *		like wild pointer writes and other bad updates into the database.
	 *		This may be slightly faster for DBs that fit entirely in RAM, but
	 *		is slower for DBs larger than RAM.
	 *		Incompatible with nested transactions.
	 *		Do not mix processes with and without MDB_WRITEMAP on the same
	 *		environment.  This can defeat durability (#mdb_env_sync etc).
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOMETASYNC
	 *		Flush system buffers to disk only once per transaction, omit the
	 *		metadata flush. Defer that until the system flushes files to disk,
	 *		or next non-MDB_RDONLY commit or #mdb_env_sync(). This optimization
	 *		maintains database integrity, but a system crash may undo the last
	 *		committed transaction. I.e. it preserves the ACI (atomicity,
	 *		consistency, isolation) but not D (durability) database property.
	 *		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOSYNC
	 *		Don't flush system buffers to disk when committing a transaction.
	 *		This optimization means a system crash can corrupt the database or
	 *		lose the last transactions if buffers are not yet flushed to disk.
	 *		The risk is governed by how often the system flushes dirty buffers
	 *		to disk and how often #mdb_env_sync() is called.  However, if the
	 *		filesystem preserves write order and the #MDB_WRITEMAP flag is not
	 *		used, transactions exhibit ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation)
	 *		properties and only lose D (durability).  I.e. database integrity
	 *		is maintained, but a system crash may undo the final transactions.
	 *		Note that (#MDB_NOSYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) leaves the system with no
	 *		hint for when to write transactions to disk, unless #mdb_env_sync()
	 *		is called. (#MDB_MAPASYNC | #MDB_WRITEMAP) may be preferable.
	 *		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	 *	<li>#MDB_MAPASYNC
	 *		When using #MDB_WRITEMAP, use asynchronous flushes to disk.
	 *		As with #MDB_NOSYNC, a system crash can then corrupt the
	 *		database or lose the last transactions. Calling #mdb_env_sync()
	 *		ensures on-disk database integrity until next commit.
	 *		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOTLS
	 *		Don't use Thread-Local Storage. Tie reader locktable slots to
	 *		#MDB_txn objects instead of to threads. I.e. #mdb_txn_reset() keeps
	 *		the slot reserved for the #MDB_txn object. A thread may use parallel
	 *		read-only transactions. A read-only transaction may span threads if
	 *		the user synchronizes its use. Applications that multiplex many
	 *		user threads over individual OS threads need this option. Such an
	 *		application must also serialize the write transactions in an OS
	 *		thread, since LMDB's write locking is unaware of the user threads.
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOLOCK
	 *		Don't do any locking. If concurrent access is anticipated, the
	 *		caller must manage all concurrency itself. For proper operation
	 *		the caller must enforce single-writer semantics, and must ensure
	 *		that no readers are using old transactions while a writer is
	 *		active. The simplest approach is to use an exclusive lock so that
	 *		no readers may be active at all when a writer begins.
	 *	<li>#MDB_NORDAHEAD
	 *		Turn off readahead. Most operating systems perform readahead on
	 *		read requests by default. This option turns it off if the OS
	 *		supports it. Turning it off may help random read performance
	 *		when the DB is larger than RAM and system RAM is full.
	 *		The option is not implemented on Windows.
	 *	<li>#MDB_NOMEMINIT
	 *		Don't initialize malloc'd memory before writing to unused spaces
	 *		in the data file. By default, memory for pages written to the data
	 *		file is obtained using malloc. While these pages may be reused in
	 *		subsequent transactions, freshly malloc'd pages will be initialized
	 *		to zeroes before use. This avoids persisting leftover data from other
	 *		code (that used the heap and subsequently freed the memory) into the
	 *		data file. Note that many other system libraries may allocate
	 *		and free memory from the heap for arbitrary uses. E.g., stdio may
	 *		use the heap for file I/O buffers. This initialization step has a
	 *		modest performance cost so some applications may want to disable
	 *		it using this flag. This option can be a problem for applications
	 *		which handle sensitive data like passwords, and it makes memory
	 *		checkers like Valgrind noisy. This flag is not needed with #MDB_WRITEMAP,
	 *		which writes directly to the mmap instead of using malloc for pages. The
	 *		initialization is also skipped if #MDB_RESERVE is used; the
	 *		caller is expected to overwrite all of the memory that was
	 *		reserved in that case.
	 *		This flag may be changed at any time using #mdb_env_set_flags().
