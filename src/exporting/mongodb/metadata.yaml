  exporter_description: |
    Use the MongoDB connector for the exporting engine to archive your Agent's metrics to a MongoDB database
    for long-term storage, further analysis, or correlation with data from other sources.

setup:
  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: ''
        description: |
          - To use MongoDB as an external storage for long-term archiving, you should first [install](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/c/c-driver/current/libmongoc/tutorials/obtaining-libraries/installing/#std-label-installing) libmongoc 1.7.0 or higher.
          - Next, re-install Netdata from the source, which detects that the required library is now available.
  configuration:
    file:
      name: 'exporting.conf'
    options:
      description: |
        The following options can be defined for this exporter.
      folding:
        title: 'Config options'
        enabled: true
      list:
        - name: 'enabled'
          default_value: 'no'
          description: 'Enables or disables an exporting connector instance (yes|no).'
          required: true
        - name: 'destination'
          default_value: 'localhost'
          description: 'Accepts a space separated list of hostnames, IPs (IPv4 and IPv6) and ports to connect to. Netdata will use the first available to send the metrics.'
          required: true
          detailed_description: |
            The format of each item in this list, is: [PROTOCOL:]IP[:PORT].
            - PROTOCOL can be udp or tcp. tcp is the default and only supported by the current exporting engine.
            - IP can be XX.XX.XX.XX (IPv4), or [XX:XX...XX:XX] (IPv6). For IPv6 you can to enclose the IP in [] to separate it from the port.
            - PORT can be a number of a service name. If omitted, the default port for the exporting connector will be used.

            Example IPv4:
              ```yaml
              destination = 10.11.14.2:27017 10.11.14.3:4242 10.11.14.4:27017
              ```
            Example IPv6 and IPv4 together:
            ```yaml
            destination = [ffff:...:0001]:2003 10.11.12.1:2003
            ```
            When multiple servers are defined, Netdata will try the next one when the previous one fails.

            Frequency of sending sending data to the external database, in seconds.
          required: false
          detailed_description: |
            Netdata will add some randomness to this number, to prevent stressing the external server when many Netdata servers
            send data to the same database. This randomness does not affect the quality of the data, only the time they are sent.
        - name: 'buffer on failures'
          default_value: '10'
          description: |
            The number of iterations (`update every` seconds) to buffer data, when the external database server is not available.
          required: false
          detailed_description: |
            If the server fails to receive the data after that many failures, data loss on the connector instance is expected (Netdata will also log it).

          description: |
            Hosts filter. Determines which hosts will be sent to the external database. The syntax is [simple patterns](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/src/libnetdata/simple_pattern#simple-patterns).
          required: false
          detailed_description: |
            Includes one or more space separated patterns, using * as wildcard (any number of times within each pattern).
            The patterns are checked against the hostname (the localhost is always checked as localhost), allowing us to
            filter which hosts will be sent to the external database when this Netdata is a central Netdata aggregating multiple hosts.

            A pattern starting with `!` gives a negative match. So to match all hosts named `*db*` except hosts containing `*child*`,
            use `!*child* *db*` (so, the order is important: the first pattern matching the hostname will be used - positive or negative).
        - name: 'send charts matching'
          default_value: '*'
          description: |
            One or more space separated patterns (use * as wildcard) checked against both chart id and chart name.
          required: false
          detailed_description: |
            A pattern starting with ! gives a negative match. So to match all charts named apps.* except charts ending in *reads,
            use !*reads apps.* (so, the order is important: the first pattern matching the chart id or the chart name will be used,
            positive or negative). There is also a URL parameter filter that can be used while querying allmetrics. The URL parameter
            has a higher priority than the configuration option.

          description: 'Controls the metric names Netdata should send to the external database (yes|no).'
          required: false
          detailed_description: |
            Netdata supports names and IDs for charts and dimensions. Usually IDs are unique identifiers as read by the system and names
            are human friendly labels (also unique). Most charts and metrics have the same ID and name, but in several cases they are
            different : disks with device-mapper, interrupts, QoS classes, statsd synthetic charts, etc.

            The default socket timeout depends on the exporting connector update interval.
            The timeout is 500 ms shorter than the interval (but not less than 1000 ms). You can alter the timeout using the sockettimeoutms MongoDB URI option.
