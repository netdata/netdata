Usage:

    "${0}" start|stop PORT [BACKEND_HOST BACKEND_PORT]

    PORT          The port this script will listen
                  (configure netdata to use this as a second backend)

    BACKEND_HOST  The real backend host
    BACKEND_PORT  The real backend port

    This script can act as fallback backend for netdata.
    It will receive metrics from netdata, save them to
    ${FILE}
    and once netdata reconnects to the real-backend, this script
    will push all metrics collected to the real-backend too and
    wait for a failure to happen again.

    Only one netdata can connect to this script at a time.
    If you need fallback for multiple netdata, run this script
    multiple times with different ports.

    You can run me in the background with this:

    screen -d -m "${0}" start PORT [BACKEND_HOST BACKEND_PORT]
EOF
	exit 1
