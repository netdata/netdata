# Agent Dashboard

Every Netdata installation comes with a comprehensive dashboard featuring hundreds of pre-configured charts that help you understand your system's performance at a glance.

There are two ways to access your Agent's dashboard:

- Directly at `http://localhost:19999` or `http://NODE_IP:19999`.
- Through app.netdata.cloud after connecting your Agent.
