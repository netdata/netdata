### Understand the alert

This alert calculates the `ping packet loss` percentage to the network host over the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it means that your network is experiencing increased packet loss.

### What does ping packet loss mean?

Ping is a command used to test the reachability of a host on a network. It measures the round-trip-time (RTT) for packets sent from the source host to the destination host. Packet loss occurs when these packets are not successfully delivered to their destination.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check for network congestion:

   Excessive network traffic can cause packet loss. Use tools like `iftop`, `nload`, or `bmon` to monitor your network bandwidth usage and identify possible congestion sources.

2. Inspect the network hardware:

   Faulty network hardware like routers, switches, and cables can lead to packet loss. Examine the physical network hardware for possible issues and ensure that all devices are functioning properly.

3. Test the connection to the destination host:

   Use the `ping` command to test the connection to the destination host:

   ```
   ping <destination_host>
   ```

   If you experience consistent packet loss, it may indicate an issue with the destination host or the network path leading to it.

4. Check the destination host:

   If the destination host is under heavy load or experiencing issues, it may cause packet loss. Check the host's resources, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space, and resolve any issues if necessary.

5. Investigate possible packet loss causes:

   Some factors that can cause packet loss include network congestion, poor network equipment performance, corrupt data packets, or interference from other devices. Analyze your network traffic and pinpoint the cause of the packet loss.

6. Rectify any identified issues:

   Once you've identified the cause of the packet loss, take appropriate measures to resolve it. This may involve updating network hardware, optimizing network traffic, or fixing issues with the destination host.
