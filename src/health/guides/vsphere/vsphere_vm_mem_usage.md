### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when a virtual machine's memory usage in a vSphere environment is significantly higher than normal, indicating potential performance issues or insufficient memory allocation.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. **Check memory usage**: Monitor the virtual machine's memory usage to identify potential bottlenecks or high memory consumption by applications.

2. **Inspect applications**: Review applications running on the virtual machine to identify those consuming excessive memory, and determine if it's expected behavior or a memory leak.

3. **Adjust memory allocation**: If the virtual machine consistently has high memory usage, consider increasing the allocated memory to improve performance.

4. **Optimize applications**: Identify opportunities to optimize applications running on the virtual machine to reduce memory consumption.

5. **Monitor performance**: Keep an eye on the virtual machine's performance metrics to ensure that changes in memory usage or allocation do not negatively impact performance.
