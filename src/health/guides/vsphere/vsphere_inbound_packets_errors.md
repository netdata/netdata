### Understand the alert

The `vsphere_inbound_packets_errors` alert is generated when there are inbound network errors in a VMware vSphere virtual machine. It calculates the number of inbound errors for the network interface in the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it indicates that your virtual machine's network is experiencing errors, which could lead to issues with network performance, reliability, or availability.

### Causes of network errors

There are several reasons for network errors, including:

1. Faulty hardware: physical problems with network adapters, cables, or switch ports.
2. Configuration issues: incorrect network settings or driver issues.
3. Network congestion: heavy traffic leading to packet loss or delays.
4. Corrupted packets: data transmission errors caused by software bugs or electro-magnetic interference.

### Troubleshoot the alert

Follow these steps to troubleshoot the `vsphere_inbound_packets_errors` alert:

1. Log in to the vSphere client and select the affected virtual machine.

2. Check the VM's network settings:
  - Verify that the network adapter is connected.
  - Check if the network adapter's driver is up-to-date.

3. Review network performance:
  - Examine the virtual machine's performance charts to identify high network utilization or packet loss.
  - Use network monitoring tools, like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `mtr`, to check the network connectivity and latency.

4. Inspect the physical network:
  - Look for damaged cables or disconnected switch ports.
  - Ensure that the network equipment, like switches and routers, is operating correctly and is up-to-date.

5. Analyze system logs:
  - Check the virtual machine's logs for any network-related errors or warnings.
  - Investigate the vSphere host logs for issues involving network hardware or configurations.

6. If errors persist, consult VMware support or documentation for further guidance.
