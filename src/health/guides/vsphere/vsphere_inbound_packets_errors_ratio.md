### Understand the alert

The `vsphere_inbound_packets_errors_ratio` alert presents the ratio of inbound packet errors for the network interface of a virtual machine (VM) in VMware vSphere. If the ratio is equal to or greater than 2% and there are at least 10k packets within a 10 minute period, the alert switches to the warning state.

### What are packet errors?

Packet errors occur when there's an issue with the packet during transmission. Common reasons include:

1. Transmission errors, where a packet is damaged on its way to its destination.
2. Format errors, where the packet's format doesn't match what the receiving device was expecting.

Damaged packets can occur due to bad cables, bad ports, broken fiber cables, dirty fiber connectors, or high radio frequency interference.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the affected virtual machine and its corresponding network interface by checking the alert details.

2. Inspect the network hardware by checking for any visible damage or loose connections related to the affected network interface. This may include Ethernet cables, fiber cables, and connectors. Replace or repair any damaged components.

3. Check for radio frequency interference from nearby devices, such as Bluetooth devices or microwaves. If interference is suspected, move or disable the interfering devices, or consider using shielded cables for network connections.

4. Monitor vSphere network performance and error metrics by using VMware vSphere's monitoring tools or other third-party monitoring software, such as Netdata. This can help pinpoint which network devices, interfaces, or protocols are causing packet errors.

5. Verify that network devices and virtual machines are configured correctly to ensure optimal network performance. This may include checking Quality of Service (QoS) settings, VLAN configurations, or network resource allocation.

6. Update VMware vSphere to the latest version, as well as the network drivers and firmware of the physical host, to ensure compatibility and bug fixes are applied.

7. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to VMware support for further assistance.
