### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the number of inbound discarded packets for a network interface on a Windows system exceeds the threshold (5 packets) within the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it means that your network interface may have an issue that is causing packets to be discarded.

### What does inbound discarded packets mean?

Inbound discarded packets refer to network packets that are received by the network interface but are not processed by the system. Packets may be discarded for various reasons such as network congestion, packet corruption, or reaching the system's capacity limits.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the problematic network interface

To find out which network interface is causing the problem, log in to the Windows system and open **Performance Monitor**. Go to the **Windows → Networking → Network Interface** section in the left pane and check the **Packets Received Discarded** counter to identify the offending interface.

2. Check network interface hardware

Verify that the network interface is working correctly and hasn't malfunctioned. Inspect the cables and ensure that they are connected properly. If possible, try a different network interface.

3. Check network congestion and bandwidth usage

High network congestion and bandwidth usage can cause packets to be discarded. Monitor your network's usage and check for any unusual patterns or excessive bandwidth usage. Consider using a network monitoring tool to gather more in-depth information about your network.

4. Inspect system logs

Check system logs for errors or warnings related to the network interface. The Windows Event Viewer can be a valuable resource for identifying issues related to the network interface. 

5. Update network adapter drivers

Outdated or incompatible drivers can cause network issues, including inbound discarded packets. Ensure that your network adapter drivers are up-to-date and provided by a reliable source.

6. Investigate packet corruption

Packet corruption can be caused by faulty hardware, software issues, or even cyber-attacks. Ensure that your system is adequately protected, and investigate any possible software-related issues that may lead to packet corruption.
