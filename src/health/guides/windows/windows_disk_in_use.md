### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the disk space utilization on a Windows system surpasses the defined thresholds. If you receive this alert, it means your system's disk usage is high, and you might need to free up space.

### Why is disk space utilization important?

Disk space utilization is crucial for the stable and efficient operation of your system. As the disk fills up, system processes may slow down or fail due to insufficient storage space. Moreover, new applications and updates may require additional storage, which can cause issues if not enough disk space is available.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check disk usage in detail

   To check the disk usage on your Windows system, you can use `Disk Management` tool by searching for it in the Start menu, or by right-clicking on Computer in the File Explorer and selecting "Manage."

2. Analyze disk usage by folders and files

   Use a disk space analyzer tool like [TreeSize](https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free) or [WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/) to find the largest files and folders on your system. These tools will help you identify areas where you can free up space.

3. Clean up unnecessary files

   - Empty the recycle bin on your Windows system.
   - In the File Explorer, right-click on the system drive (usually C:), and select "Properties." Navigate to the "General" tab and click on "Disk Cleanup" to free up space by removing temporary files, system files and other items that can be safely deleted.
   - Uninstall unused applications using the Programs and Features setting in the Control Panel.
   - Move larger files such as media or documents to an external storage device or cloud storage service.

4. Monitor disk usage

   Keep an eye on the disk usage to prevent it from surpassing the threshold again in the future. Pay attention to system and software updates that may require additional storage, as well as the growth of log files or temporary files generated by your computer's operation.
