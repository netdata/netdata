### Understand the alert

This alert is related to the VerneMQ MQTT broker, and it triggers when there is a high number of socket errors in the last minute. Socket errors can occur due to various reasons, such as network connectivity issues or resource contention on the system running the VerneMQ broker.

### What are socket errors?

Socket errors are issues related to network communication between the VerneMQ broker and its clients. They usually occur when there are problems establishing or maintaining a stable network connection between the server and clients. Examples of socket errors include connection timeouts, connection resets, unreachable hosts, and other network-related problems.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check the VerneMQ logs for more information:

   VerneMQ logs can give you a better understanding of the cause of the socket errors. You can find the logs at `/var/log/vernemq/console.log` or `/var/log/vernemq/error.log`. Look for any errors or warning messages that might be related to the socket errors.

2. Monitor the system's resources:

   Use the `top`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, or `netstat` commands to monitor your system's resource usage, such as CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and network activity. Check if there are any resource bottlenecks or excessive usage that might be causing the socket errors.

3. Check network connectivity:

   Verify that there are no issues with the network connectivity between the VerneMQ broker and its clients. Use tools such as `ping`, `traceroute`, or `mtr` to check the connectivity and latency of the network.

4. Make sure the VerneMQ broker is running:

   Ensure that the VerneMQ broker process is running and listening for connections. You can use the `ps` command to check if the `vernemq` process is running, and the `netstat` command to verify that it's listening on the expected ports.

5. Inspect client configurations and logs:

   It's possible that the root cause of the socket errors is related to the MQTT clients. Check their configurations and logs for any signs of issues or misconfigurations that could be causing socket errors when connecting to the VerneMQ broker.
