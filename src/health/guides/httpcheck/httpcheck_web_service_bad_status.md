### Understand the alert

The `httpcheck_web_service_bad_status` alert is generated by the Netdata Agent when monitoring the status of an HTTP web service using the `httpcheck` collector. This alert is triggered when the HTTP web service returns a non-successful status code (anything other than 2xx or 3xx), indicating that there is an issue with the web service, preventing it from responding to requests as expected.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. **Verify the target URL**: Ensure that the target URL configured in the `httpcheck` collector is correct and accessible. Check for any typos or incorrect domain names.

2. **Check the actual response status and the expected response status**: Try to implement a request with a verbose result:

```
root@netdata # curl -v <your_http_endpoint>:<port>/<path>
```

3. **Verify server resources**: Ensure that your server has enough resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) to handle the current workload. High resource utilization can lead to web service issues. You can use Netdata's dashboard to monitor the server resources in real-time.

4. **Check server configuration**: Review the configuration files of the web service for any misconfigurations or settings that may be causing the issue. For example, incorrect permissions, wrong file paths, or improper configurations can lead to bad status codes.
