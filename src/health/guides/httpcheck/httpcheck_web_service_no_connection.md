### Understand the alert

This alert monitors the percentage of failed HTTP requests to a specific URL in the last 5 minutes. If you receive this alert, it means that your web service experienced connection issues.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Verify HTTP service status

Check if the web service is running and accepting requests. If the service is down, restart it and monitor the situation.

2. Review server logs

Examine the logs of the web server hosting the HTTP service. Look for any errors or warning messages that may provide more information about the cause of the connection issues.

3. Check network connectivity

If the server hosting the HTTP service is experiencing connectivity issues, it can lead to failed requests. Ensure that the server has stable network connectivity.

4. Monitor server resources

Inspect the server's resource usage to check if it is running out of resources, such as CPU, memory, or disk space. If the server is running low on resources, it can cause the HTTP service to malfunction. In this case, free up resources or upgrade the server.

5. Review client connections

It is also possible that the clients are having connectivity issues. Make sure that the clients are in a good network condition and can connect to the server without any issues.

6. Test the HTTP service

Perform HTTP requests to the service manually or using monitoring tools to measure response times and verify if the issue persists.
