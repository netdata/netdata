### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when there are events recorded in the IPMI System Event Log (SEL). These events can range from critical, warning, and informational events. The alert enters a warning state when the number of events in the IPMI SEL exceeds 0, meaning there are recorded events that may require your attention.

### What is IPMI SEL?

The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) System Event Log (SEL) is a log that records events related to hardware components and firmware on a server. These events can provide insight into potential issues with the server's hardware or firmware, which could impact the server's overall performance or stability.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. **Use `ipmitool` to view the IPMI SEL events:**

   You can view the System Event Log using the `ipmitool` command. If you don't have `ipmitool` installed, you might need to install it first. Once `ipmitool` is installed, use the following command to list the SEL events:

   ```
   ipmitool sel list
   ```

   This command will display the recorded events with their respective timestamp, event ID, and a brief description.

2. **Identify and resolve issues:**

   Analyze the events listed to identify any critical or warning events that may require immediate attention. You may need to refer to your server's hardware documentation or firmware updates to resolve the issue.

3. **Clear the IPMI SEL events (optional):**

   If you have resolved the issues or if the events listed are no longer relevant, you can clear the IPMI SEL events using the following command:

   ```
   ipmitool sel clear
   ```

   Note: Clearing the SEL events may cause you to lose important historical information related to your hardware components and firmware. Be cautious when using this command, and ensure that you have resolved any critical issues before clearing the event log.
