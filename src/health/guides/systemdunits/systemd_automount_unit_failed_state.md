### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when a `systemd` automount unit enters the `failed` state. It means that a mounted filesystem has failed or experienced an error and thus is not available for use.

### What is an automount unit?

An automount unit is a type of `systemd` unit that handles automounting filesystems. It defines when, where, and how a filesystem should be automatically mounted on the system. Automount units use the `.automount` file extension and are typically located in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the failed automount unit(s)

To list all `systemd` automount units and their states, run the following command:

```
systemctl list-units --all --type=automount
```

Look for the unit(s) with a `failed` state.

2. Check the automount unit file

Examine the failed unit's configuration file in `/etc/systemd/system/` or `/lib/systemd/system/` (depending on your system). If there is an error in the configuration, fix it and reload the `systemd` configuration.

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

3. Check the journal for errors

Use the `journalctl` command to check for any system logs related to the failed automount unit:

```
sudo journalctl -u [UnitName].automount
```

Replace `[UnitName]` with the name of the failed automount unit. Analyze the logs to identify the root cause of the failure.

4. Attempt to restart the automount unit

After identifying and addressing the cause of the failure, try to restart the automount unit:

```
sudo systemctl restart [UnitName].automount
```

Check the unit's status:

```
systemctl status [UnitName].automount
```

If it's in the `active` state, the issue has been resolved.
