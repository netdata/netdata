      [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) (pronounce: notify) is a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, entirely without signup, cost or setup. It's also [open source](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) if you want to run your own server.
      You can send alerts to an ntfy server using Netdata's Agent alert notification feature, which supports dozens of endpoints, user roles, and more.

              You can define multiple recipient URLs like this: `https://SERVER1/TOPIC1` `https://SERVER2/TOPIC2`

              All roles will default to this variable if left unconfigured.

              You can then have different servers and/or topics per role, by editing DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_NTFY with the server-topic combination you want, in the following entries at the bottom of the same file:
              ```text
              role_recipients_ntfy[sysadmin]="https://SERVER1/TOPIC1"
