            - The incoming webhook URL as given by Discord. Create a webhook by following the official [Discord documentation](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). You can use the same on all your Netdata servers (or you can have multiple if you like - your decision).
            - One or more Discord channels to post the messages to
            - Access to the terminal where Netdata Agent is running

              All roles will default to this variable if left unconfigured.
              You can then have different channels per role, by editing `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_DISCORD` with the channel you want, in the following entries at the bottom of the same file:
              ```text
              role_recipients_discord[sysadmin]="systems"
              role_recipients_discord[domainadmin]="domains"
              role_recipients_discord[dba]="databases systems"
              role_recipients_discord[webmaster]="marketing development"
              role_recipients_discord[proxyadmin]="proxy-admin"
              role_recipients_discord[sitemgr]="sites"
              ```

              The values you provide should already exist as Discord channels in your server.
