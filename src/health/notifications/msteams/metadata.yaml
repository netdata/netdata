            detailed_description: |
              In Microsoft Teams the channel name is encoded in the URI after `/IncomingWebhook/`. You can define multiple channels like this: `CHANNEL1` `CHANNEL2`.

              All roles will default to this variable if left unconfigured.

              You can have different channels per role, by editing `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_MSTEAMS` with the channel you want, in the following entries at the bottom of the same file:
              ```text
              role_recipients_msteams[sysadmin]="CHANNEL1"
              role_recipients_msteams[domainadmin]="CHANNEL2"
              role_recipients_msteams[dba]="databases CHANNEL3"
              role_recipients_msteams[webmaster]="CHANNEL4"
              role_recipients_msteams[proxyadmin]="CHANNEL5"
              role_recipients_msteams[sitemgr]="CHANNEL6"
              ```
