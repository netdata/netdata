            - Complete the "Configure SQL Server for Monitoring" steps in the Setup -> Prerequisites section.

          - title: Configure SQL Server for Monitoring
            description: |
              For **each SQL Server** instance you want to monitor, complete the following steps:

              1. **Create Monitoring User**

                 Create an SQL Server user with the necessary permissions to collect monitoring data:

                 ```tsql
                 USE master;
                 CREATE LOGIN netdata_user WITH PASSWORD = '1ReallyStrongPasswordShouldBeInsertedHere';
                 CREATE USER netdata_user FOR LOGIN netdata_user;
                 GRANT CONNECT SQL TO netdata_user;
                 GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO netdata_user;
                 GO
                 ```

              2. **Enable Query Store**

                 Enable the [Query Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/performance/monitoring-performance-by-using-the-query-store?view=sql-server-ver16) and grant access               to    the monitoring user on all relevant databases:

                 ```tsql
                 DECLARE @dbname NVARCHAR(max)
                 DECLARE nd_user_cursor CURSOR FOR SELECT name
                                     FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
                                     WHERE name NOT IN ('master')

                 OPEN nd_user_cursor
                 FETCH NEXT FROM nd_user_cursor INTO @dbname
                 WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
                 BEGIN
                   EXECUTE ("USE "+ @dbname+"; CREATE USER netdata_user FOR LOGIN netdata_user; ALTER DATABASE "+@dbname+" SET QUERY_STORE = ON ( QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = ALL, DATA_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS               =    900 )");
                   FETCH next FROM nd_user_cursor INTO @dbname;
                 END
                 CLOSE nd_user_cursor
                 DEALLOCATE nd_user_cursor
                 GO
                 ```

              3. **Configure SQL Server Network Settings**

                 Enable SQL Server to accept TCP connections:

                - Open `SQL Server Configuration Manager`
                - Expand `SQL Server Network Configuration`
                - Select `Protocols for <instance name>` in the console panel
                - Double-click the `TCP` protocol in the details panel and set `Enabled` to `Yes`
                - Go to the `IP Address` tab and locate the `IPAII` section:
                  - Clear any value from the `TCP Dynamic Ports` field
                  - Enter a port number in the `TCP Port` field (default is `1433`)
                - Select `SQL Server Services` and restart your SQL Server instance

              4. **Configure SQL Server Authentication (Optional)**

                 If you're using SQL Server authentication (rather than Windows authentication):

                - Open `SQL Server Management Studio`
                - Right-click your server and select `Properties`
                - Select `Security` in the left panel
                - Choose `SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode` under `Server authentication`
                - Click `OK`
                - Right-click your server and select `Restart`
