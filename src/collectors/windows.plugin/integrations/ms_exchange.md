## Overview

This collector monitors Microsoft Exchange.


It queries different Exchange objects from Perflib in order to gather the metrics.


This collector is only supported on the following platforms:

- windows

This collector only supports collecting metrics from a single instance of this integration.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

The collector automatically detects all of the metrics, no further configuration is required.


#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.

## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per Windows Exchange

These metrics refer to Windows Exchange.

This scope has no labels.
