          - title: Install perf plugin
            description: |
              If you are [using our official native DEB/RPM packages](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/packaging/installer/UPDATE.md#determine-which-installation-method-you-used), make sure the `netdata-plugin-perf` package is installed.
          - title: Enable the pref plugin
            description: |
              The plugin is disabled by default because the number of PMUs is usually quite limited and it is not desired to allow Netdata to struggle silently for PMUs, interfering with other performance monitoring software.

              To enable it, use `edit-config` from the Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`, to edit the `netdata.conf` file.

              ```bash
              cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
              sudo ./edit-config netdata.conf
              ```

              Change the value of the `perf` setting to `yes` in the `[plugins]` section. Save the file and restart the Netdata Agent with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate method](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/packaging/installer/README.md#maintaining-a-netdata-agent-installation) for your system.

              You can run `perf.plugin` with the debug option enabled, to troubleshoot issues with it. The output should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

              - Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

                ```bash
                cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
                ```

              - Switch to the `netdata` user.

                ```bash
                sudo -u netdata -s
                ```

              - Run the `perf.plugin` in debug mode:

                ```bash
                ./perf.plugin 1 all debug
                ```
