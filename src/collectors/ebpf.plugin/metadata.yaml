              Check if your kernel was compiled with necessary options (CONFIG_KPROBES, CONFIG_BPF, CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, CONFIG_BPF_JIT) in `/proc/config.gz` or inside /boot/config file. Some cited names can be different accoring preferences of Linux distributions.
              When you do not have options set, it is necessary to get the kernel source code from https://kernel.org or a kernel package from your distribution, this last is preferred. The kernel compilation has a well definedd pattern, but distributions can deliver their configuration files
              with different names.

              Now follow steps:
              1. Copy the configuration file to /usr/src/linux/.config.
              2. Select the necessary options: make oldconfig
              3. Compile your kernel image: make bzImage
              4. Compile your modules: make modules
              5. Copy your new kernel image for boot loader directory
              6. Install the new modules: make modules_install
              7. Generate an initial ramdisk image (`initrd`) if it is necessary.
              8. Update your boot loader

            description: |
              Check if your kernel was compiled with necessary options (CONFIG_KPROBES, CONFIG_BPF, CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL, CONFIG_BPF_JIT) in `/proc/config.gz` or inside /boot/config file. Some cited names can be different accoring preferences of Linux distributions.
              When you do not have options set, it is necessary to get the kernel source code from https://kernel.org or a kernel package from your distribution, this last is preferred. The kernel compilation has a well definedd pattern, but distributions can deliver their configuration files
              with different names.

              Now follow steps:
              1. Copy the configuration file to /usr/src/linux/.config.
              2. Select the necessary options: make oldconfig
              3. Compile your kernel image: make bzImage
              4. Compile your modules: make modules
              5. Copy your new kernel image for boot loader directory
              6. Install the new modules: make modules_install
              7. Generate an initial ramdisk image (`initrd`) if it is necessary.
              8. Update your boot loader

              When you do not have options set, it is necessary to get the kernel source code from https://kernel.org or a kernel package from your distribution, this last is preferred. The kernel compilation has a well definedd pattern, but distributions can deliver their configuration files
