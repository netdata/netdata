#
# Global options
#
# The `ebpf load mode` option accepts the following values :
#  `entry` : The eBPF collector only monitors calls for the functions, and does not show charts related to errors.
#  `return : In the `return` mode, the eBPF collector monitors the same kernel functions as `entry`, but also creates
#            new charts for the return of these functions, such as errors.
#
# The eBPF collector also creates charts for each running application through an integration with the `apps.plugin`
# or `cgroups.plugin`.
# If you want to disable the integration with `apps.plugin` or `cgroups.plugin` along with the above charts, change the setting 
# `apps` and `cgroups` to  'no'.
#
# The `update every` option defines the number of seconds used to read data from kernel and send to netdata
#
# The `pid table size` defines the maximum number of PIDs stored in the application hash tables.
#
# The `btf path` specifies where to find the BTF files.
#
# The `maps per core` defines if hash tables will be per core or not. This option is ignored on kernels older than 4.15.
#
# The `lifetime` defines the time length a thread will run when it is enabled by a function.
#

#
# eBPF Programs
#
# The eBPF collector has the following eBPF programs:
#
#  `cachestat` : Make charts for kernel functions related to page cache.
#  `dcstat`    : Make charts for kernel functions related to directory cache.
#  `disk`      : Monitor I/O latencies for disks
#  `fd`        : This eBPF program creates charts that show information about file manipulation.
#  `filesystem`: Monitor calls for functions used to manipulate specific filesystems
#  `hardirq`   : Monitor latency of serving hardware interrupt requests (hard IRQs).
#  `mdflush`   : Monitors flush counts for multi-devices.
#  `mount`     : Monitor calls for syscalls mount and umount
#  `oomkill`   : This eBPF program creates a chart that shows which process got OOM killed and when.
#  `process`   : This eBPF program creates charts that show information about process life.
#  `shm`       : Monitor calls for syscalls shmget, shmat, shmdt and shmctl.
#  `socket`    : This eBPF program creates charts with information about `TCP` and `UDP` functions, including the
#                bandwidth consumed by each.
#  `softirq`   : Monitor latency of serving software interrupt requests (soft IRQs).
#  `sync`      : Monitor calls for syscall sync(2).             
#  `swap`      : Monitor calls for internal swap functions.
#  `vfs`       : This eBPF program creates charts that show information about process VFS IO, VFS file manipulation and
#               files removed.
#
# When plugin detects that system has support to BTF, it enables integration with apps.plugin.
