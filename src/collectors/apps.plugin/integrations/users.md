## Overview

This integration monitors resource utilization on a user context.



This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per user

These metrics refer to the user.

Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| user | The name of the user. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| user.cpu_utilization | user, system | percentage |
| user.cpu_guest_utilization | guest | percentage |
| user.cpu_context_switches | voluntary, involuntary | switches/s |
| user.mem_usage | rss | MiB |
| user.mem_private_usage | mem | MiB |
| user.vmem_usage | vmem | MiB |
| user.mem_page_faults | minor, major | pgfaults/s |
| user.swap_usage | swap | MiB |
| user.disk_physical_io | reads, writes | KiB/s |
| user.disk_logical_io | reads, writes | KiB/s |
| user.processes | processes | processes |
| user.threads | threads | threads |
| user.fds_open_limit | limit | percentage |
| user.fds_open | files, sockets, pipes, inotifies, event, timer, signal, eventpolls, other | fds |
| user.uptime | uptime | seconds |
| user.uptime_summary | min, avg, max | seconds |
