    setup:
      prerequisites:
        list:
          - title: "Install charts.d plugin"
            description: |
              If [using our official native DEB/RPM packages](/packaging/installer/UPDATE.md#determine-which-installation-method-you-used), make sure `netdata-plugin-chartsd` is installed.
          - title: "Permissions to execute `ipsec`"
            description: |
              The plugin executes 2 commands to collect all the information it needs:
              
              ```sh
              ipsec whack --status
              ipsec whack --trafficstatus
              ```
              
              The first command is used to extract the currently established tunnels, their IDs and their names.
              The second command is used to extract the current uptime and traffic.
              
              Most probably user `netdata` will not be able to query libreswan, so the `ipsec` commands will be denied.
              The plugin attempts to run `ipsec` as `sudo ipsec ...`, to get access to libreswan statistics.
              
              To allow user `netdata` execute `sudo ipsec ...`, create the file `/etc/sudoers.d/netdata` with this content:
              
              ```
              netdata ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ipsec whack --status
              netdata ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ipsec whack --trafficstatus
              ```
              
              Make sure the path `/sbin/ipsec` matches your setup (execute `which ipsec` to find the right path).
