              The `go_expvar` collector is disabled by default. To enable it, use `edit-config` from the Netdata [config directory](/docs/netdata-agent/configuration/README.md), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`, to edit the `python.d.conf` file.

              ```bash
              cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
              sudo ./edit-config python.d.conf
              ```

              Change the value of the `go_expvar` setting to `yes`. Save the file and restart the Netdata Agent with `sudo systemctl restart netdata`, or the [appropriate method](/docs/netdata-agent/start-stop-restart.md) for your system.
          - title: "Sample `expvar` usage in a Go application"
            description: |
              The `expvar` package exposes metrics over HTTP and is very easy to use.
              Consider this minimal sample below:
              
              ```go
              package main
              
              import (
                      _ "expvar"
                      "net/http"
              )
              
              func main() {
                      http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:8080", nil)
              }
              ```
              
              When imported this way, the `expvar` package registers a HTTP handler at `/debug/vars` that
              exposes Go runtime's memory statistics in JSON format. You can inspect the output by opening
              the URL in your browser (or by using `wget` or `curl`).
              
              Sample output:
              
              ```json
              {
              "cmdline": ["./expvar-demo-binary"],
              "memstats": {"Alloc":630856,"TotalAlloc":630856,"Sys":3346432,"Lookups":27, <omitted for brevity>}
              }
              ```
              
              You can of course expose and monitor your own variables as well.
              Here is a sample Go application that exposes a few custom variables:
              
              ```go
              package main
              
              import (
                  "expvar"
                  "net/http"
                  "runtime"
                  "time"
              )
              
              func main() {
              
                  tick := time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)
                  num_go := expvar.NewInt("runtime.goroutines")
                  counters := expvar.NewMap("counters")
                  counters.Set("cnt1", new(expvar.Int))
                  counters.Set("cnt2", new(expvar.Float))
              
                  go http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
              
                  for {
                      select {
                      case <- tick.C:
                          num_go.Set(int64(runtime.NumGoroutine()))
                          counters.Add("cnt1", 1)
                          counters.AddFloat("cnt2", 1.452)
                      }
                  }
              }
              ```
              
              Apart from the runtime memory stats, this application publishes two counters and the
              number of currently running Goroutines and updates these stats every second.

            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified. Each JOB can be used to monitor a different Go application.

              description: |
                The example below sets a configuration for a Go application, called `app1`. Besides the `memstats`, the application also exposes two counters and the number of currently running Goroutines and updates these stats every second.
                
                The `go_expvar` collector can monitor these as well with the use of the `extra_charts` configuration variable.
                
                The `extra_charts` variable is a YaML list of Netdata chart definitions.
                Each chart definition has the following keys:
                
                ```
                id:         Netdata chart ID
                options:    a key-value mapping of chart options
                lines:      a list of line definitions
                ```
                
                **Note: please do not use dots in the chart or line ID field.
                See [this issue](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/pull/1902#issuecomment-284494195) for explanation.**
                
                
                **Line definitions**
                
                Each chart can define multiple lines (dimensions).
                A line definition is a key-value mapping of line options.
                Each line can have the following options:
                
                ```
                # mandatory
                expvar_key: the name of the expvar as present in the JSON output of /debug/vars endpoint
                expvar_type: value type; supported are "float" or "int"
                id: the id of this line/dimension in Netdata
                
                # optional - Netdata defaults are used if these options are not defined
                name: ''
                algorithm: absolute
                multiplier: 1
                divisor: 100 if expvar_type == float, 1 if expvar_type == int
                hidden: False
                ```
                
                Please see the following link for more information about the options and their default values:
                [External plugins - dimensions](/src/plugins.d/README.md#dimension)
                
                Apart from top-level expvars, this plugin can also parse expvars stored in a multi-level map;
                All dicts in the resulting JSON document are then flattened to one level.
                Expvar names are joined together with '.' when flattening.
                
                Example:
                
                ```
                {
                    "counters": {"cnt1": 1042, "cnt2": 1512.9839999999983},
                    "runtime.goroutines": 5
                }
                ```
                
                In the above case, the exported variables will be available under `runtime.goroutines`,
                `counters.cnt1` and `counters.cnt2` expvar_keys. If the flattening results in a key collision,
                the first defined key wins and all subsequent keys with the same name are ignored.
