          It uses the `hddtemp` daemon to gather the metrics.

          - title: Run `hddtemp` in daemon mode
            description: |
              You can execute `hddtemp` in TCP/IP daemon mode by using the `-d` argument.
              
              So running `hddtemp -d` would run the daemon, by default on port 7634.
      configuration:
        file:
          name: "python.d/hddtemp.conf"
        options:
          description: |
            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
            
            By default this collector will try to autodetect disks (autodetection works only for disk which names start with "sd"). However this can be overridden by setting the option `disks` to an array of desired disks.
