              RetroShare needs to be configured to enable the RetroShare WEB Interface and allow access from the Netdata host.
      configuration:

          name: python.d/retroshare.conf
        options:
          description: |
            There are 2 sections:
            
            * Global variables
            * One or more JOBS that can define multiple different instances to monitor.
            
            The following options can be defined globally: priority, penalty, autodetection_retry, update_every, but can also be defined per JOB to override the global values.
            
            Additionally, the following collapsed table contains all the options that can be configured inside a JOB definition.
            
            Every configuration JOB starts with a `job_name` value which will appear in the dashboard, unless a `name` parameter is specified.
