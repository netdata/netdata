## Overview

zRAM, or compressed RAM, is a block device that uses a portion of your system's RAM as a block device.
The data written to this block device is compressed and stored in memory.

The collectors provides information about the operation and the effectiveness of zRAM on your system.




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per zram device



Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| device | TBD |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| mem.zram_usage | compressed, metadata | MiB |
| mem.zram_savings | savings, original | MiB |
| mem.zram_ratio | ratio | ratio |
| mem.zram_efficiency | percent | percentage |
