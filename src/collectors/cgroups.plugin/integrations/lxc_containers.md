Plugin: cgroups.plugin
Module: /sys/fs/cgroup

## Overview

Monitor LXC Containers for performance, resource usage, and health status.



This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.

## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per cgroup



Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| container_name | The container name or group path if name resolution fails. |
| image | Docker/Podman container image name. |

### Per cgroup network device



Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| container_name | The container name or group path if name resolution fails. |
| image | Docker/Podman container image name. |
| device | The name of the host network interface linked to the container's network interface. |
| container_device | Container network interface name. |
| interface_type | Network interface type. Always "virtual" for the containers. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| cgroup.net_net | received, sent | kilobits/s |
| cgroup.net_packets | received, sent, multicast | pps |
| cgroup.net_errors | inbound, outbound | errors/s |
| cgroup.net_drops | inbound, outbound | errors/s |
| cgroup.net_fifo | receive, transmit | errors/s |
| cgroup.net_compressed | receive, sent | pps |
| cgroup.net_events | frames, collisions, carrier | events/s |
| cgroup.net_operstate | up, down, notpresent, lowerlayerdown, testing, dormant, unknown | state |
| cgroup.net_carrier | up, down | state |
| cgroup.net_mtu | mtu | octets |
