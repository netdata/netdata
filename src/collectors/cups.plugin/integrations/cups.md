# CUPS

Plugin: cups.plugin
Module: cups.plugin

## Overview

Monitor CUPS performance for achieving optimal printing system operations. Monitor job statuses, queue lengths, and error rates to ensure smooth printing tasks.

The plugin uses CUPS shared library to connect and monitor the server.

This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.

The plugin needs to access the server. Netdata sets permissions during installation time to reach the server through its library.

### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

The plugin detects when CUPS server is running and tries to connect to it.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per CUPS instance



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| cups.dests_state | idle, printing, stopped | dests |
| cups.dests_option | total, acceptingjobs, shared | dests |
| cups.job_num | pending, held, processing | jobs |
| cups.job_size | pending, held, processing | KB |

### Per destination



This scope has no labels.

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| cups.destination_job_num | pending, held, processing | jobs |
| cups.destination_job_size | pending, held, processing | KB |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup
