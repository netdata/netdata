#
# There are two queues involved when incoming TCP connections are handled
# (both at the kernel):
#
# SYN queue
# The SYN queue tracks TCP handshakes until connections are fully established.
# It overflows when too many incoming TCP connection requests hang in the
# half-open state and the server is not configured to fall back to SYN cookies.
# Overflows are usually caused by SYN flood DoS attacks (i.e. someone sends
# lots of SYN packets and never completes the handshakes).
#
# Accept queue
# The accept queue holds fully established TCP connections waiting to be handled
# by the listening application. It overflows when the server application fails
# to accept new connections at the rate they are coming in.

# tcp SYN queue (at the kernel)

# When the SYN queue is full, either TcpExtTCPReqQFullDoCookies or
# TcpExtTCPReqQFullDrop is incremented, depending on whether SYN cookies are
# enabled or not. In both cases this probably indicates a SYN flood attack,
# so i guess a notification should be sent.
