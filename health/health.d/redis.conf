    units: seconds
     info: Duration of the ongoing RDB save operation. \
           Saving RDB snapshot on disk is taking too long. \
           Possible reasons are that the dataset size is big or the lack of CPU resources. \
           It may result in Redis stopping serving clients for some millisecond or even for one second.
