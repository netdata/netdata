     info: Number of physical drive predictive failures. \
           There are physical drive predictive failures. \
           The failure prediction function for the hard disk drives determines the risk of a failure in advance \
           and issues a warning when the risk is high. \
           A hard disk can still operate normally but may fail in the near future. \
           You might want to consider replacing the disk.

     info: Number of physical drive media errors. \
           There are physical drive media errors. \
           It may indicate that a bad sector was found on the media, there is a mechanical failure of the device, \
           the host device detected an invalid sequence, or the target device is missing.

## Battery Backup Units (BBU)

     type: System
component: RAID
   lookup: average -10s
    units: percent
    every: 10s
     warn: $this <= (($status >= $WARNING)  ? (85) : (80))
     crit: $this <= (($status == $CRITICAL)  ? (50) : (40))
     info: Average battery backup unit relative state of charge over the last 10 seconds. \
           The state of charge is low. \
           The relative state of charge is an indication of full charge capacity percentage in relation to the design capacity. \
           A constantly low value may indicate that the battery is worn out. \
           You might want to consider changing the battery.

     info: Average battery backup unit charge cycles count over the last 10 seconds. \
           A high number of full recharge cycles. \
           It affects the battery capacity. \
           You might want to consider changing the battery.
