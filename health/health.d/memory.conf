     info: Number of ECC correctable errors in the last 10 minutes. \
           There are ECC correctable errors. \
           This event does not immediately lead to problems, but it may indicate one of the DIMM modules is slowly failing. \
           Check contacts and, if this error occurs more than once, consider replacing the DIMM as a preventative measure.

     info: Number of ECC uncorrectable errors in the last 10 minutes. \
           There are ECC uncorrectable errors. This is a fatal issue. \
           While the error may be due to a failing DRAM chip, \
           it can also be caused by incorrect seating or improper contact between the socket and DIMM. \
           Check contacts and consider replacing the DIMM as a preventative measure.
