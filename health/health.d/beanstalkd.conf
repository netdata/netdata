     info: Number of buried jobs across all tubes. \
           There are buried jobs. \
           It usually happens if something goes wrong while the consumer processes it. \
           The presence of buried jobs in a tube does not affect new jobs. \
           You need to manually kick the jobs, so they can be processed.
