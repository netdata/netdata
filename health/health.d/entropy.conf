     info: Minimum number of bits in the random numbers pool in the last 5 minutes. \
           A low number of bits of entropy available. \
           It impacts quality of security and \
           may affect the performance of applications that use the pool. \
           This can be fixed by installing the [haveged] or [rngd] daemon.
