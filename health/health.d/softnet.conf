     info: Average number of dropped packets in the last minute due to exceeded netdev backlog queue. \
           Netdev backlog queue is full. \
           It results in packets received by the interface and not yet processed by the destined subsystem or \
           userland application being dropped. \
           To fix, increase the [net.core.netdev_max_backlog] limit.

     info: Average number of times ksoftirq ran out of netdev_budget over the last minute. \
           SoftIRQ was unable to process all packets available before the CPU budget was exhausted. \
           It may result in packet drops and is typically caused by a high-bandwidth interface adding more packets \
           to the receive buffer than can be processed during NAPI polling. \
           To fix, increase the [net.core.netdev_budget] limit.
