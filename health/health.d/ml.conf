# below are some examples of using the `anomaly-bit` option to define alerts based on anomaly 
# rates as opposed to raw metric values. You can read more about the anomaly-bit and Netdata's 
# native anomaly detection here:

# some examples below are commented, you would need to uncomment and adjust as desired to enable them.
