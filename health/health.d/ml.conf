# below are some examples of using the `anomaly-bit` option to define alerts based on anomaly 
# rates as opposed to raw metric values. You can read more about the anomaly-bit and Netdata's 
# native anomaly detection here:

# examples below are commented, you would need to uncomment and adjust as desired to enable them.

# alert per dimension example
# if anomaly rate is between 5-20% then warning (pick your own threshold that works best via tial and error).
# if anomaly rate is above 20% then critical (pick your own threshold that works best via tial and error).
