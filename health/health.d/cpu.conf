           You can check the CPU PSI charts if there is CPU contention and \
           per-process CPU usage to find the top consumers.

           High system CPU iowait time. \
           A constantly high value indicates that IO is a bottleneck, which can make the system run slower.

    delay: down 1h multiplier 1.5 max 2h
     info: Average CPU steal time over the last 20 minutes. \
           High system CPU steal time. \
           A large amount of steal time indicates CPU contention on the host system, which can reduce guest performance. \
           To fix, increase the guest CPU priority or CPU quota, or run fewer guests on the host.
