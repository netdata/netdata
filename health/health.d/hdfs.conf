     info: Percentage of used space capacity across all datanodes. \
           High datanodes space capacity utilization. \
           To fix this, you can add additional disks/datanodes and rebalance the datanode/cluster.

    delay: down 15m multiplier 1.5 max 1h
     info: Number of missing blocks. \
           There are missing blocks on some datanodes. \
           It may indicate a problem with the underlying storage or filesystem of a datanode. \
           To fix, you can find what blocks are missing using [hdfs fsck] and bring the blocks back online. \
           If the file can not be restored, you should delete the file.

    delay: down 15m multiplier 1.5 max 1h
     info: Number of stale datanodes. \
           There are stale datanodes due to delayed heartbeat. \
           Some datanodes did not respond to heartbeats. \
           The stale datanodes are given the lowest priority for reads and writes. \
           If the datanode is not back online for a while, it will be considered dead.

           There are dead datanodes. \
           Any data that was registered to a dead datanode is not available to HDFS anymore.

    delay: down 15m multiplier 1.5 max 1h
     info: Number of failed volumes. \
           There are failed volumes on some datanodes. \
           It may indicate a hardware failure or misconfiguration, e.g. duplicate mounts. \
           By default, a single volume failing on a datanode will cause the entire node to go offline. \
           The namenode must copy any under-replicated blocks that were lost on that node, \
           causing a burst in network traffic and potential performance degradation.
