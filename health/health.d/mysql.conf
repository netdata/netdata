     info: Number of slow queries in the last 10 seconds. \
           A high number of slow queries. \
           A query is slow if it has taken more than [long_query_time] seconds. \
           The value is measured in real-time, not CPU time. \
           If you are concerned with query execution time, check system load and consider optimizing the queries.

           High ratio of waited table locks. \
           If this is constantly high and you have performance problems, \
           you should first optimize your queries and then either split your table or tables or use replication.
