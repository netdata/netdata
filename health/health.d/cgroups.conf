# check for packet storms

# 1. calculate the rate packets are received in 1m: 1m_received_packets_rate
# 2. do the same for the last 10s
# 3. raise an alarm if the later is 10x or 20x the first
# we assume the minimum packet storm should at least have
# 10000 packets/s, average of the last 10 seconds
