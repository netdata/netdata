#
# This creates an alert on a statsd gauge metric named `dummy`. If the gauge is
# at or over 42, it will trigger a warning, if at or over 100, a critical
# alert. Note that statd gauges are considered no longer collected if there was
# no update for 10 minutes. In this case, this alert also goes away.
#
# To send the value `41` to this metric use this command:
#
#     echo "dummy:41|g" | nc -w 1 localhost 8125
