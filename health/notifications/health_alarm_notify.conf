# Configuration for alarm notifications
#
# This configuration is used by: alarm-notify.sh
# changes take effect immediately (the next alarm will use them).
#
# alarm-notify.sh can send:
# - e-mails (using the sendmail command),
# - push notifications to your mobile phone (pushover.net),
# - messages to your slack team (slack.com),
# - messages to your alerta server (alerta.io),
# - messages to your flock team (flock.com),
# - messages to your discord guild (discordapp.com),
# - messages to your telegram chat / group chat (telegram.org)
# - sms messages to your cell phone or any sms enabled device (twilio.com)
# - sms messages to your cell phone or any sms enabled device (messagebird.com)
# - sms messages to your cell phone or any sms enabled device (smstools3)
# - notifications to users on pagerduty.com
# - push notifications to iOS devices (via prowlapp.com)
# - notifications to Amazon SNS topics (aws.amazon.com)
# - messages to your irc channel on your selected network
# - messages to a local or remote syslog daemon
# - message to Microsoft Team (through webhook)
# - message to Rocket.Chat (through webhook)
# - message to Google Hangouts Chat (through webhook)
#
# The 'to' line given at netdata alarms defines a *role*, so that many
# people can be notified for each role.
#
# This file is a BASH script itself.
#
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# proxy configuration
#
# If you need to send curl based notifications (pushover, pushbullet, slack, alerta,
# flock, discord, telegram) via a proxy, set these to your proxy address:
#export http_proxy="http://10.0.0.1:3128/"
#export https_proxy="http://10.0.0.1:3128/"


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# notifications images
#
# Images in notifications need to be downloaded from an Internet facing site.
# To allow notification providers fetch the icons/images, by default we set
# the URL of the global public netdata registry.
# If you have an Internet facing netdata (or you have copied the images/ folder
# of netdata to your web server), set its URL here, to fetch the notification
# images from it.
#images_base_url="http://my.public.netdata.server:19999"


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# date handling
#
# You can configure netdata alerts to send dates in any format you want.
# This uses standard `date` command format strings.  See `man date` for
# more info on what you can put in here.  Note that this has to start with a '+', otherwise it won't work.
#
# For ISO 8601 dates, use '+%FT%T%z'
# For RFC 5322 dates, use '+%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z'
# For RFC 3339 dates, use '+%F %T%:z'
# For RFC 1123 dates, use '+%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z'
# For RFC 1036 dates, use '+%A, %d-%b-%y %H:%M:%S %Z'
# For a reasonably local date and time (in that order), use '+%x %X'
# For the old default behavior (compatible with ANSI C's asctime() function), leave this empty.
date_format=''


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# hostname handling
#
# By default, Netdata will use the simple hostname for the system (the
# hostname with everything after the first `.` removed) when displaying
# the hostname in alert notifications.  If you prefer, you can uncomment
# the line below to have Netdata instead use the host's fully qualified
# domain name.
#
# This does not report correct FQDN's for slave systems for which this
# sytem is a master.
#
# Additionally, if the system host name is overridden in /etc/netdata.conf
# with the `hostname` option, that name will be used unconditionally
# instead of this.
#use_fqdn='YES'

# NOTE ABOUT RECIPIENTS
#
# When you define recipients (all types):
#
#  - emails addresses
#  - pushover user tokens
#  - telegram chat ids
#  - slack channels
#  - alerta environment
#  - flock rooms
#  - discord channels
#  - hipchat rooms
#  - sms phone numbers
#  - pagerduty.com (pd) services
#  - irc channels
#
# You can append |critical to limit the notifications to be sent.
#
# In these examples, the first recipient receives all the alarms
# while the second one receives only the critical ones:
#
#  email      : "user1@example.com user2@example.com|critical"
#  pushover   : "2987343...9437837 8756278...2362736|critical"
#  telegram   : "111827421 112746832|critical"
#  slack      : "alarms disasters|critical"
#  alerta     : "alarms disasters|critical"
#  flock      : "alarms disasters|critical"
#  discord    : "alarms disasters|critical"
#  twilio     : "+15555555555 +17777777777|critical"
#  messagebird: "+15555555555 +17777777777|critical"
#  kavenegar  : "09155555555 09177777777|critical"
#  pd         : "<pd_service_key_1> <pd_service_key_2>|critical"
#  irc        : "<irc_channel_1> <irc_channel_2>|critical"
#  hangouts   : "alarms disasters|critical"
#
# If a recipient is set to empty string, the default recipient of the given
# notification method (email, pushover, telegram, slack, alerta, etc) will be used.
# To disable a notification, use the recipient called: disabled
# This works for all notification methods (including the default recipients).

#EMAIL_CHARSET="UTF-8"

# You can also have netdata add headers to the message that will
# cause most e-mail clients to treat all notifications for a given
# chart+alarm+host combination as a single thread.  This can help
# simplify tracking of alarms, as it provides an easy wway for scripts
# to corelate messages and also will cause most clients to group all the
# messages together.  This is enabled by default, uncomment the line
# below if you want to disable it.
#EMAIL_THREADING="NO"

# enable/disable sending syslog notifications
# NOTE: make sure you have everything else configured the way you want
# it _before_ turning this on.
SEND_SYSLOG="NO"

# A note on log levels and facilities:
#
# The traditional UNIX syslog mechanism has the concept of both log
# levels and facilities.  A log level indicates the relaitve severity of
# the message, while a facility specifies a generic source for the message
# (for example, the `mail` facility is where sendmail and postfix log
# their messages).  All major syslog daemons have the ability to filter
# messages based on both log level and facility, and can often also make
# routing decisions for messages based on both factors.
#
# On Linux, the eight log levels in decreasing order of severity are:
# emerg, alert, crit, err, warning, notice, info, debug
#
# By default, warnings will be logged at the warning level, critical
# alerts at the crit level, and clear notifications at the invo level.
#
# And the 19 facilities you can log to are:
# auth, authpriv, cron, daemon, ftp, lpr, mail, news, syslog, user,
# uucp, local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5, local6, and local7
#
# By default, netdata alerts will be logged to the local6 facility.
#
# Depending on your distribution, this means that either all your
# netdata alerts will by default end up in the main system log (usually
# /var/log/messages), or they won't be logged to a file at all.
# Neither of these are likely to be what you actually want, but any
# configuration to change that needs to happen in the syslog daemon
# configuration, not here.

# This controls which facility is used by default for logging.  Defaults
# to local6.
SYSLOG_FACILITY=''

# If a role's recipients are not configured, use the following.
# (empty = do not send a notification for unconfigured roles)
#
# The recipient format for syslog uses the following format:
# [[facility.level][@host[:port]]/]prefix
#
# `prefix` gets appended to the front of all log messages generated for
# that recipient.  The prefix is mandatory.
# 'host' and 'port' can be used to specify a remote syslog server to
# send messages to.  Leave these out if you want messages to be delivered
# locally.  'host' can be either a hostname or an IP address.
# IPv6 addresses must have square around them.
# 'facility' and 'level' are used to override the default logging facility
# set above and the log level.  If one is specified, both must be present.
#
# For example, to send messages with a 'netdata' prefix to a syslog
# daemon listening on port 514 on 'loghost' using the daemon facility and
# notice log level:
# DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_SYSLOG='daemon.notice@loghost:514/netdata'
