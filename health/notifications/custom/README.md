# Custom

Netdata allows you to send custom notifications to any endpoint you choose.

To configure custom notifications, you will need to customize `health_alarm_notify.conf`. Open the file for editing
using [`edit-config`](/docs/configure/nodes.md#use-edit-config-to-edit-configuration-files) from the [Netdata config
directory](/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

You can look at the other senders in `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/alarm-notify.sh` for examples of how to modify the `custom_sender()` function in `health_alarm_notify.conf`.

As with other notifications, you will also need to define the recipient list in `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_CUSTOM` and/or the `role_recipients_custom` array.

The following is a sample `custom_sender` function in `health_alarm_notify.conf`, to send an SMS via an imaginary HTTPS endpoint to the SMS gateway:

```
 custom_sender() {
    # example human readable SMS
    local msg="${host} ${status_message}: ${alarm} ${raised_for}"

    # limit it to 160 characters and encode it for use in a URL
    urlencode "${msg:0:160}" >/dev/null; msg="${REPLY}"

    # a space separated list of the recipients to send alarms to
    to="${1}"

    for phone in ${to}; do
      httpcode=$(docurl -X POST \
				    --data-urlencode "From=XXX" \
				    --data-urlencode "To=${phone}" \
				    --data-urlencode "Body=${msg}" \
				    -u "${accountsid}:${accounttoken}" \
        https://domain.website.com/)

       if [ "${httpcode}" = "200" ]; then
         info "sent custom notification ${msg} to ${phone}"
         sent=$((sent + 1))
       else
         error "failed to send custom notification ${msg} to ${phone} with HTTP error code ${httpcode}."
       fi
    done
}
```
