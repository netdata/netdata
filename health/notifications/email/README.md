# Email Agent alert notifications

Learn how to send notifications via Email using Netdata's Agent alert notification feature, which supports dozens of endpoints, user roles, and more.

> ### Note
>
> This file assumes you have read the [Introduction to Agent alert notifications](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/notifications/README.md), detailing how the Netdata Agent's alert notification method works.

Email notifications look like this:

## Prerequisites

You will need:

- A working `sendmail` command for email alerts to work. Almost all MTAs provide a `sendmail` interface.  
  Netdata sends all emails as user `netdata`, so make sure your `sendmail` works for local users.

   > ### Note
   >
   > If you are using our Docker images, or are running Netdata on a system that does not have a working `sendmail` command, see [the section below about using msmtp in place of sendmail](#using-msmtp-instead-of-sendmail).
- terminal access to the Agent you wish to configure

## Configure Netdata to send alerts via Email

> ### Info
>
> This file mentions editing configuration files.  
>
> - To edit configuration files in a safe way, we provide the [`edit config` script](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#use-edit-config-to-edit-configuration-files) located in your [Netdata config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory) (typically is `/etc/netdata`) that creates the proper file and opens it in an editor automatically.  
> Note that to run the script you need to be inside your Netdata config directory.
>
> It is recommended to use this way for configuring Netdata.

Edit `health_alarm_notify.conf`, changes to this file do not require restarting Netdata:

1. You can change `EMAIL_SENDER` to the email address sending the notifications, the default is the system user Netdata runs as, usually being `netdata`.  
   Supported formats are:

   ```conf
   EMAIL_SENDER="user@domain"
   EMAIL_SENDER="User Name <user@domain>"
   EMAIL_SENDER="'User Name' <user@domain>"
   EMAIL_SENDER="\"User Name\" <user@domain>"
   ```

2. Set `SEND_EMAIL` to `YES`.
3. Set `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` to the email address you want the email to be sent by default.  
   You can define multiple email addresses like this: `alarms@example.com systems@example.com`.  
   All roles will default to this variable if left unconfigured.
4. There are also other optional configuration entries that can be found in the same section of the file.

You can then have different email addresses per **role**, by editing `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` with the email address you want, in the following entries at the bottom of the same file:

```conf
role_recipients_email[sysadmin]="systems@example.com"
role_recipients_email[domainadmin]="domains@example.com"
role_recipients_email[dba]="databases@example.com systems@example.com"
role_recipients_email[webmaster]="marketing@example.com development@example.com"
role_recipients_email[proxyadmin]="proxy-admin@example.com"
role_recipients_email[sitemgr]="sites@example.com"
```

An example of a working configuration would be:

```conf
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# email global notification options

EMAIL_SENDER="example@domain.com"
SEND_EMAIL="YES"
DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL="recipient@example.com"
```

### Filtering

Every notification email (both the plain text and the rich html versions) from the Netdata agent, contain a set of custom email headers that can be used for filtering using an email client. Example:

```conf
X-Netdata-Severity: warning
X-Netdata-Alert-Name: inbound_packets_dropped_ratio
X-Netdata-Chart: net_packets.enp2s0
X-Netdata-Family: enp2s0
X-Netdata-Classification: System
X-Netdata-Host: winterland
X-Netdata-Role: sysadmin
```

### Using msmtp instead of sendmail

[msmtp](https://marlam.de/msmtp/) provides a simple alternative to a full-blown local mail server and `sendmail`
that will still allow you to send email notifications. It comes pre-installed in our Docker images, and is available
on most distributions in the system package repositories.

To use msmtp with Netdata for sending email alerts:

1. If itâ€™s not already installed, install msmtp. Most distributions have it in their package repositories with the package name `msmtp`.
2. Modify the `sendmail` path in `health_alarm_notify.conf` to point to the location of `msmtp`:

   ```conf
   # The full path to the sendmail command.
   # If empty, the system $PATH will be searched for it.
   # If not found, email notifications will be disabled (silently).
   sendmail="/usr/bin/msmtp"
   ```

3. Login as netdata:

   ```sh
   (sudo) su -s /bin/bash netdata
   ```

4. Configure `~/.msmtprc` as shown [in the documentation](https://marlam.de/msmtp/documentation/).
5. Finally set the appropriate permissions on the `.msmtprc` file :

   ```sh
   chmod 600 ~/.msmtprc
   ```

## Test the notification method

To test this alert notification method refer to the ["Testing Alert Notifications"](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/health/notifications/README.md#testing-alert-notifications) section of the Agent alert notifications page.
