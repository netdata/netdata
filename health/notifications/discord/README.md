You need:

1.  The **incoming webhook URL** as given by Discord. Create a webhook by following the official [Discord documentation](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks). You can use the same on all your Netdata servers (or you can have multiple if you like - your decision).
2.  One or more Discord channels to post the messages to.

Set them in `/etc/netdata/health_alarm_notify.conf` (to edit it on your system run `/etc/netdata/edit-config health_alarm_notify.conf`), like this:

```
###############################################################################
# sending discord notifications

# note: multiple recipients can be given like this:
#                  "CHANNEL1 CHANNEL2 ..."

# enable/disable sending discord notifications
SEND_DISCORD="YES"

# Create a webhook by following the official documentation -
# https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/XXXXXXXXXXXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# if a role's recipients are not configured, a notification will be send to
# this discord channel (empty = do not send a notification for unconfigured
# roles):
DEFAULT_RECIPIENT_DISCORD="alarms"
```

You can define multiple channels like this: `alarms systems`.
You can give different channels per **role** using these (at the same file):

```
role_recipients_discord[sysadmin]="systems"
role_recipients_discord[dba]="databases systems"
role_recipients_discord[webmaster]="marketing development"
```

The keywords `systems`, `databases`, `marketing`, `development` are discordapp.com channels (they should already exist within your discord server).
