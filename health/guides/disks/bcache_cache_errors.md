### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the number of read races in the last minute on a `bcache` system has increased. A read race occurs when a `bucket` is reused and invalidated while it's being read from the cache. In this situation, the data is reread from the slower backing device.

### What is bcache?

`bcache` is a cache within the block layer of the Linux kernel. It enables fast storage devices, such as SSDs (Solid State Drives), to act as a cache for slower storage devices like HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). This creates hybrid volumes with improved performance. A cache device is usually divided into `buckets` that match the physical disk's erase blocks.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Verify the current `bcache` cache errors:

   ```
   grep bcache_cache_errors /sys/fs/bcache/*/stats_total/*
   ```

   This command will show the total number of cache errors for all `bcache` devices.

2. Identify the affected backing device:

   You can determine the affected backing device by checking the `/sys/fs/bcache` directory. Look for the symbolic link that points to the problematic device.

   ```
   ls -l /sys/fs/bcache
   ```

   This command will show the list of devices with corresponding names.

3. Monitor the cache device's performance:

   Use `iostat` to check the cache device's I/O performance.

   ```
   iostat -x -h -p /dev/YOUR_CACHE_DEVICE
   ```

   Note that you should replace `YOUR_CACHE_DEVICE` with the actual cache device name.

4. Check the utilization of the cache and backing devices:

   Use the following commands to check the utilization percentage of the cache and backing devices:

   ```
   # for the cache device (/dev/YOUR_CACHE_DEVICE)
   cat /sys/block/YOUR_CACHE_DEVICE/bcache/utilization
    
   # for the backing device (/dev/YOUR_BACKING_DEVICE)
   cat /sys/block/YOUR_BACKING_DEVICE/bcache/utilization
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_CACHE_DEVICE` and `YOUR_BACKING_DEVICE` with the respective device names.

5. Optimize the cache:

   - If the cache utilization is high, consider increasing the cache size or adding more cache devices.
   - If the cache device is heavily utilized, consider upgrading it to a faster SSD.
   - In case the read races persist, consider using a [priority caching strategy](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/bcache.html#priority-caching).

   You may also need to review your system's overall I/O load and adjust your caching strategy accordingly.
