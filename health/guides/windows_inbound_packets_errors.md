### Understand the alert

This alert informs you about the number of `inbound errors` on the network interface of your Windows machine within the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it indicates that there might be issues with your network connection or hardware.

### What are inbound errors?

Inbound errors refer to problems that occur when packets are coming into the network interface of your machine from external sources. These errors might occur due to various reasons such as packet loss during transmission, hardware problems in the network interface card (NIC), or incorrect network configurations.

### Troubleshoot the alert

To troubleshoot this alert, you can perform the following steps:

1. Check the network connection

   Ensure that the network connection is stable and the cables (if any) are properly connected. If you're using a wireless connection, verify that the signal strength is good and that there are no known Wi-Fi issues in your area.

2. Verify network configurations

   Go through your network configurations and ensure that they are properly set. Some common issues include incorrect IP addresses, subnet masks or gateways. Open the Network Connections window (press Windows key + R, type `ncpa.cpl` and click OK), then right-click your network adapter, select `Properties`, and recheck your configurations.

3. Inspect the hardware

   Check if the NIC experiences any physical issues or if it gets overheated. If you suspect a hardware problem, consider replacing the NIC or connecting to a different network interface to isolate the issue.

4. Monitor the network for any anomalies

   You can use native Windows tools like `Performance Monitor` or `Resource Monitor` to keep an eye on network performance and packet errors. Open the respective tools by searching in the Start Menu.

5. Review Event Viewer logs

   Look for any network-related errors logged in the `Event Viewer`. Press Windows key + X, select Event Viewer, and navigate to `Windows Logs` > `System`. Filter the logs by choosing the `Network Profile` event source and review the error messages.

6. Update NIC drivers

   Sometimes, outdated or faulty NIC drivers might cause inbound packet errors. Ensure that you've installed the latest drivers for your NIC. Visit the manufacturer's website to download and install the most recent drivers compatible with your Windows operating system.
