### Understand the alert

This alert monitors the BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) client's average number of active tasks over the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it means that there might be an issue with your BOINC tasks or client.

### Troubleshoot the alert

- Check the BOINC client logs

1. Locate the BOINC client log file, usually in `/var/lib/boinc-client/`.
2. Inspect the log file for any issues or error messages related to task execution, connection, or client behavior.

- Check the status of the BOINC client

1. To check the status, run the following command:

   ```
   sudo /etc/init.d/boinc-client status
   ```

2. If the client is not running, start it using:

   ```
   sudo /etc/init.d/boinc-client start
   ```

- Restart the BOINC client

1. Restart the BOINC client, in most of the Linux distros:

   ```
   sudo /etc/init.d/boinc-client restart
   ```

- Ensure your system has adequate resources

Monitoring and managing your computer resources (CPU, memory, disk space) can help ensure smooth operation of the BOINC client and its tasks. If your system is low on resources, consider freeing up space or upgrading your hardware.

- Update the BOINC client

Make sure your BOINC client is up-to-date by checking the official BOINC website (https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php) for the latest version.
