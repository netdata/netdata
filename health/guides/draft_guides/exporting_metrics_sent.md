# exporting_metrics_sent

**Netdata | Exporting engine**

The Netdata Agent calculates the percentage of metrics sent to the external database server. This alert indicates that
the exporting engine failed to send all metrics. The exporting destination may be down or unreachable. Short-term
network availability problems might be fixed by increasing `buffer on failures` in `exporting.conf`.
