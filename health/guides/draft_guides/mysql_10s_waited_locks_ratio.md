# mysql_10s_waited_locks_ratio

**Database | MySQL**

The Netdata Agent calculates the ratio of waited table locks over the last 10 seconds. This alert indicates a high ratio
of waited table locks. If this metric is constantly high and you have performance problems, you should first optimize
your queries and then either split your table or tables or use replication.
