**DHCP | Dnsmasq**

The Netdata Agent monitors the percentage of leased IP addresses. This alert indicates that the number of DHCP addresses
in use is close to the total number of provisioned DHCP addresses. To fix this issue, try to increase the number of IP
addresses on a subnet.

This alert is triggered in warning state when the percentage of leased IP addresses is between 80-90% and in critical
state when it is between 90-95%
