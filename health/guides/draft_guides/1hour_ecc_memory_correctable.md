# 1hour_ecc_memory_correctable

## OS: Linux

The Netdata Agent monitors the number of ECC correctable errors in the last 10 minutes. This alert indicates that there are
ECC correctable errors. This event does not immediately lead to problems, but it may indicate one of the memory modules
is slowly failing. Check contacts and, if this error occurs more than once, consider replacing the memory module as a
preventative measure.
