# 20min_steal_cpu

## OS: Linux

The Netdata Agent monitors the average CPU steal time over the last 20 minutes. This alert indicates high system CPU steal
time. Receiving this alert means that there is CPU contention on the host system, which can reduce guest performance. To
address this issue, you can try to increase the guest CPU priority or CPU quota, or run fewer guests on the host.
