# active_processes

## OS: Any

The Netdata Agent calculates the percentage of used PIDs. Receiving this alert means that your system's Process IDs (
PID) space utilization is at high levels. If this value is 100%, then the system can not start new processes.

This alert is triggered in warning state when the percentage of used PIDs is between 85-90% and in critical state when
it is between 90-95%.
