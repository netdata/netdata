# memcached_out_of_cache_space_time

**KV Storage | Memcached**

The Netdata Agent calculates the estimated time until the cache runs out of space if the system continues to add data at
the same rate as the past hour. This alert indicates that the cache will run out of space soon. If you are getting
values close to 100%, you will probably start experiencing evictions.
