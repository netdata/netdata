# 1hour_ecc_memory_uncorrectable

## OS: Linux

The Netdata Agent monitors the number of ECC uncorrectable errors in the last 10 minutes. This alert indicates that there
are ECC uncorrectable errors. This is a fatal issue. While primarily the error may be due to a failing RAM chip, it can
also be caused by incorrect seating or improper contact between the socket and the memory module. Check contacts and
consider replacing the memory module as a preventative measure.
