### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the percentage of timed-out HTTP requests to a specific URL goes above a certain threshold in the last 5 minutes. The alert levels are determined by the following percentage thresholds:

- Warning: 10% to 40%
- Critical: 40% or higher

The alert is designed to notify you about potential issues with the accessed HTTP endpoint.

### What does HTTP request timeout mean?

An HTTP request timeout occurs when a client (such as a web browser) sends a request to a webserver but does not receive a response within the specified time period. This can lead to a poor user experience, as the user may be unable to access the requested content or services.

### Troubleshoot the alert

- Verify the issue

Check the HTTP endpoint to see if it is responsive and reachable. You can use tools like `curl` or online services like [https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/) to check the availability of the website or service.

- Analyze server logs

Examine the server logs for any error messages or unusual patterns of behavior that may indicate a root cause for the timeout issue. For web servers such as Apache or Nginx, look for log files located in the `/var/log` directory.

- Check resource usage

High resource usage, such as CPU, memory, or disk I/O, can cause HTTP request timeouts. Use tools like `top`, `vmstat`, or `iotop` to identify resource-intensive processes. Address any performance bottlenecks by resizing the server, optimizing performance, or distributing the load across multiple servers.

- Review server configurations

Make sure your web server configurations are optimized for performance. For instance:

  1. Ensure that the `KeepAlive` feature is enabled and properly configured.
  2. Make sure that your server's timeout settings are appropriate for the type of traffic and workload it experiences.
  3. Confirm that your server is correctly configured for the number of concurrent connections it handles.

- Verify network configurations

Examine the network configurations for potential issues that can lead to HTTP request timeouts. Check for misconfigured firewalls or faulty load balancers that may be interfering with traffic to the HTTP endpoint.
