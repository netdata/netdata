# whoisquery_days_until_expiration

**Other | WHOIS**

The Netdata Agent checks the time until the domain name registration expires. This alert indicates
that the domain name registration expires soon. If you do not renew the domain it will be
deactivated soon. Consider scheduling the renewal.

This alert is raised into warning when your domain is about to expire in less than 90 days and in
critical when it will expire in less than 30 days.

### Troubleshooting section

If you still want this domain you should renew it. If you need help renewing your domain name, you
should immediately contact the registrar (or reseller) that provided your domain name registration
services for possible renewal options available to you.

To determine your current registrar of record, you may conduct a WHOIS search by visiting
whois.icann.org. Registrar information can be found on the ICANN-Accredited Registrar list.
