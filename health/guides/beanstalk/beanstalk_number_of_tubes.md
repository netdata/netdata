### Understand the alert

This alert monitors the current number of tubes on a Beanstalk server. If the number of tubes drops below 5, you will receive a warning. Tubes are used as queues for jobs in Beanstalk, and having a low number of tubes may indicate an issue with service configuration or job processing. 

### What are tubes in Beanstalk?

Beanstalk is a simple, fast work queue service that allows you to distribute tasks among different workers. In Beanstalk, *tubes* are essentially queues for jobs. Each tube stores jobs with specific priorities, Time-to-run (TTR) values, and other relevant data. Workers can reserve jobs from specific tubes, process the jobs, and delete them when finished.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check Beanstalk server status.

   Use the following command to display the current Beanstalk server status:

   ```
   beanstalkctl stats
   ```

   Look for the current number of tubes (`current-tubes`). If it is too low (below 5), proceed to the next step.

2. Identify recently deleted tubes.

   Determine if any tubes have been deleted recently. Check your application logs, Beanstalk daemon logs, or discuss with your development team to find out if any tube deletion is intentional.

3. Check for misconfigurations or code issues.

   Inspect your Beanstalk server configuration and verify that the expected tubes are correctly defined. Additionally, review the application code and deployment scripts to ensure that tubes are being created and used as intended.

4. Check worker status and processing.

   Verify that your worker processes are running and processing jobs from the tubes correctly. If there are issues with worker processes, it may lead to unused or unprocessed tubes.

5. Create missing tubes if necessary.

   If you've identified that some tubes are missing and need to be created, add the required tubes using your application code or Beanstalk configuration.
