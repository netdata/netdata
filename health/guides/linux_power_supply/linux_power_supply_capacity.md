# linux_power_supply_capacity

**Power Supply | Battery**

The Netdata Agent monitors the percentage of remaining power supply capacity. This alert indicates
that the remaining power supply capacity is low. The system can run out of power and switch off
soon as well as prepare the system for the shutdown.

This alert is triggered in warning state when the percentage of remaining power supply capacity is
less than 10% and in critical state when it is less than 5%.

### Troubleshooting section:

Restore power, replace the battery, or even consider integrating a UPS to
support your systems.

If you receive this alert regularly you may also want to check the battery of the system. It's
capacity may be degraded.
