### Understand the alert

This alert indicates that too many connections are failing to a specific TCP endpoint in the last 5 minutes. It suggests that the monitored service on that endpoint is most likely down, unreachable, or access is being denied by firewall/security rules.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check the service
   Investigate if the service at the endpoint (specific IP and port) is running as expected. Inspect service logs for issues, error messages, or indications of a shutdown event.

2. Test the endpoint
   Try to establish a connection to the flagged endpoint using tools like `telnet`, `curl`, or `nc`. These tools provide real-time feedback that can help identify problems with the endpoint:

   Example using `telnet`:
   ```
   telnet IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER
   ```

3. Examine firewall and security group rules
   Verify if there are any recent changes or newly added firewall/security group rules that might be causing the connectivity issues. Look for any rules that could be blocking the monitored port specifically or the IP range.

4. Inspect network connectivity
   Check the network connectivity between the Netdata Agent and the monitored endpoint. Ensure there are no intermittent network failures or high latency affecting the communication between the two.

5. Examine the alert configuration
   Validate the alert configuration in the `netdata.conf` file to confirm that the alert thresholds and monitored percentage of failed connections are set appropriately.

6. Check resource utilization
   High resource utilization might affect the availability of the monitored endpoint. Check if the system hosting the service has enough resources available (CPU, memory, and storage) to serve incoming requests.
