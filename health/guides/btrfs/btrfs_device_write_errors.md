### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when BTRFS (B-tree file system) encounters write errors on your system. BTRFS is a modern copy-on-write (COW) filesystem designed to address various weaknesses in traditional Linux file systems. If you receive this alert, it means that there have been issues with writing data to the file system.

### What are BTRFS write errors?

BTRFS write errors can occur when there are problems with the underlying storage devices, such as bad disks or data corruption. These errors may result in data loss or the inability to write new data to the file system. It is important to address these errors to prevent potential data loss and maintain the integrity of your file system.

### Troubleshoot the alert

- Check the BTRFS system status

Execute the following command to get the current status of your BTRFS system:
```
sudo btrfs device stats [Mount point]
```
Replace `[Mount point]` with the actual mount point of your BTRFS file system.

- Examine system logs for potential issues

Check the system logs for any signs of issues with the BTRFS file system or underlying storage devices:
```
sudo journalctl -u btrfs
```

- Check the health of the storage devices

Use the `smartctl` tool to assess the health of your storage devices. For example, to check the device `/dev/sda`, use the following command:
```
sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
```

- Repair the BTRFS file system

If there are issues with the file system, run the following command to repair it:
```
sudo btrfs check --repair [Mount point]
```
Replace `[Mount point]` with the actual mount point of your BTRFS file system.

**WARNING:** The `--repair` option should be used with caution, as it may result in data loss under certain circumstances. It is recommended to back up your data before attempting to repair the file system.
