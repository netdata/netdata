### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the success rate of DNS requests of a specific type to a specified server starts to fail. The alert checks the DNS `query_status` and warns if the success rate is not `1`, indicating unsuccessful DNS queries.

### What is a DNS query?

A DNS query is a request for information from a client machine to a DNS server, typically to resolve domain names (such as www.example.com) to IP addresses. A successful query will return the matching IP address, while an unsuccessful query may result from various issues, such as DNS server problems or network connectivity issues.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check the DNS server status and logs

   Verify if the DNS server (mentioned in the alert `${label:server}`) is up and running. Inspect the server logs for any error messages or suspicious activity.

2. Examine network connectivity

   Make sure that your system can communicate with the specified DNS server. Use standard network troubleshooting tools, such as `traceroute`, to identify possible network issues between the client machine and the DNS server.

3. Inspect the DNS query type

   This alert is specific to the DNS request type `${label:record_type}`. Check if this particular type of request is causing the issue, or if the problem is widespread across all DNS queries. Understanding the scope of the issue can help narrow down the possible causes.

4. Analyze local DNS resolver configuration

   Examine your system's `/etc/resolv.conf` file and make sure that the specified DNS server is configured correctly. Review any recent changes in the resolver configuration.

5. Monitor success rate improvements

   After resolving the issue, keep an eye on the alert to ensure that the success rate returns to `1`, indicating successful DNS requests.
