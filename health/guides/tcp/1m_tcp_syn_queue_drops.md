### Understand the alert

This alert indicates that the average number of SYN requests dropped due to the TCP SYN queue being full has exceeded a specific threshold in the last minute. A high number of dropped SYN requests may indicate a SYN flood attack, causing the system to become unresponsive to legitimate traffic.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. **Monitor incoming traffic**: Analyze the incoming network traffic to determine if there is a sudden surge in SYN requests, which might indicate a SYN flood attack. Use tools like `tcpdump`, `iftop`, or `nload` to monitor network traffic.

2. **Check system resources**: Inspect the system's CPU and memory usage to ensure there are enough resources available to handle incoming connections. High resource usage might lead to dropped SYN requests.

3. **Enable SYN cookies**: If the traffic is legitimate, consider enabling SYN cookies to help mitigate the impact of a SYN flood attack, as described in the provided guide above.

4. **Adjust SYN queue settings**: Increase the SYN queue size by adjusting the `net.core.somaxconn` and `net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog` sysctl parameters. Make sure to set these values according to your system's capacity and traffic requirements.

5. **Implement traffic filtering**: Use traffic filtering techniques such as rate limiting, IP blocking, or firewall rules to mitigate the impact of SYN flood attacks.
