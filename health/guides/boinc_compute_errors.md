### Understand the alert

The `boinc_compute_errors` alert indicates that your system has experienced an increase in the average number of compute errors over the last 10 minutes when running BOINC tasks. It is important to identify the cause of these errors and take appropriate action to minimize the impact on your system.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check the BOINC client logs
   BOINC client logs can provide useful information about compute errors. The logs can usually be found in the `/var/lib/boinc-client/` directory. Look for any error messages or information that could indicate the cause of the issues.

2. Verify the system requirements
   Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements to run the BOINC tasks. This includes checking the CPU, RAM, disk space, and any other device-specific requirements. If your system does not meet the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware or reduce the number of tasks you are running simultaneously.

3. Check for software and hardware compatibility
   Some BOINC tasks may have specific hardware or software requirements, such as GPU support or compatibility with certain operating systems. Check the BOINC project documentation for any specific requirements you may be missing.

4. Update the BOINC client software
   Make sure your BOINC client software is up-to-date, as outdated versions can cause errors or unexpected behavior. You can check for updates and download the latest version from the [official BOINC website](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php).

5. Restart the BOINC client
   If the issue persists, try restarting the BOINC client following the steps provided in the alert:

   - Abort the running task
   - Restart the BOINC client:
     ```
     root@netdata # /etc/init.d/boinc-client restart
     ```

6. Seek assistance from the BOINC community
   If you continue to experience issues after following these troubleshooting steps, consider seeking assistance from the BOINC community through forums or mailing lists.
