### Understand the alert

This alert monitors the number of `outbound errors` on the network interface of a Windows system over the last 10 minutes. If you receive this alert, it means that there are `5 or more errors` in outbound packets during that period.

### What are outbound errors?

`Outbound errors` refer to problems that occur during the transmission of packets from the network interface of your system. These errors can be due to various reasons, such as faulty hardware, incorrect configuration, or network congestion.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the network interface(s) with high outbound errors

Use the `netstat -e` command to display network statistics for each interface on your system:

```
netstat -e
```

This will show you the interfaces with errors, along with a count of errors.

2. Check for faulty hardware or cables

Visually inspect the network interface and cables for any signs of damage or disconnection. If the hardware appears to be faulty, replace it as necessary.

3. Review network configuration settings

Ensure that the network configuration on your system is correct, including the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS settings. If the configuration is incorrect, update it accordingly.

4. Monitor network traffic

Use network monitoring tools such as `Wireshark` or `tcpdump` to capture traffic on the affected interface. Analyze the captured traffic to identify any issues or patterns that may be causing the errors.

5. Check for network congestion

If the errors are due to network congestion, identify the sources of high traffic and implement measures to reduce congestion, such as traffic shaping, prioritizing, or rate limiting.

6. Update network drivers and firmware

Ensure that your network interface card (NIC) drivers and firmware are up-to-date. Check the manufacturer's website for updates and apply them as necessary.
