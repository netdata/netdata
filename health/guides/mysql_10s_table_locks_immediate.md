### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when the number of table immediate locks in MySQL increases within the last 10 seconds. Table locks are used to control concurrent access to tables, and immediate locks are granted when the requested lock is available.

### What are table immediate locks?

In MySQL, table immediate locks are a mechanism for managing concurrent access to tables. When a table lock is requested and is available, an immediate lock is granted, allowing the process to continue execution. This ensures that multiple processes can't modify the data simultaneously, which could cause data inconsistencies.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the queries causing the table locks:
   
   You can use the following command to display the process list in MySQL, which will include information about the locks:

   ```
   SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;
   ```

2. Analyze the queries:

   Check the queries causing the table locks to determine if they are necessary, can be optimized, or should be terminated. To terminate a specific query, use the `KILL QUERY` command followed by the connection ID:

   ```
   KILL QUERY connection_id;
   ```

3. Check table lock status:

   To get more information about the lock status, you can use the following command to display the lock status of all tables:

   ```
   SHOW OPEN TABLES WHERE in_use > 0;
   ```

4. Optimize database queries and configurations:

   Improve query performance by optimizing the queries and indexing the tables. Additionally, check your MySQL configuration and adjust it if necessary to minimize the number of locks required.

5. Monitor the lock situation:

   Keep monitoring the lock situation with the `SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST` command to see if the problem persists. If the issue is not resolved, consider increasing the MySQL lock timeout or seek assistance from a database administrator or the MySQL community.
