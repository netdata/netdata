### Understand the alert

The `vsphere_outbound_packets_errors` alert is triggered when there is a high number of outbound network errors on a virtual machine's network interface in the last 10 minutes. This alert is related to the vSphere environment and indicates a possible issue with the virtual machine's network configuration or the underlying virtual network infrastructure.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the virtual machine with the issue

   The alert should show you the name or identifier of the virtual machine(s) facing the high number of outbound packet errors.

2. Check the network interface configuration

   Verify the virtual machine's network interface configuration within vSphere. Please ensure the configuration matches the expected settings and is correctly connected to the right virtual network.

3. Monitor virtual network infrastructure

   Inspect the virtual switches (vSwitches), port groups, and distributed switches in the vSphere environment. Look for misconfigurations, high packet loss rates, or other issues that may cause these errors.

4. Check physical network infrastructure

   Investigate if there are any problems with the physical network components, such as NICs (Network Interface Cards), switches, or cables. As issues at the physical layer could also result in network packet errors.

5. Examine virtual machine logs

   Review the virtual machine's logs for any network-related errors or warnings. This might give you more information about the root cause of the problem.

6. Update network drivers and tools

   Ensure that the latest version of network drivers and VMware tools are installed on the virtual machine. Outdated or incorrect drivers can result in packet errors.

7. Contact support

   If you cannot resolve the issue after completing the above steps, contact your vSphere support team for further assistance.
