### Understand the alert

This alert indicates that your BOINC node is experiencing an increase in the average number of failed uploads over the last 10 minutes. Failed uploads can affect the overall efficiency of your BOINC setup and may result in lost work and wasted computational resources.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check for a new BOINC client's version

   Verify if there's a new version of the BOINC client available for your system on the [BOINC client downloads page](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download_all.php). If there's a new version available, download and install the _recommended_ version.

2. Verify BOINC project configuration

   Ensure that your BOINC client is properly configured to work on the projects you're participating in. Double-check your account login credentials, project URLs, and other settings in the BOINC client. Refer to the [BOINC User Manual](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/User_manual) for more information on configuring your BOINC client.

3. Check network connectivity

   Verify that your system has a stable network connection and there are no firewall or proxy issues that might be blocking your BOINC client from uploading files. If necessary, adjust your firewall settings or connect to a different network.

4. Inspect BOINC client logs

   Consult the BOINC client logs to gain insight into the upload errors. The logs can be found in the client's data directory. Refer to the [BOINC log file documentation](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Log_Files) for more information on how to read and analyze the logs.

5. Contact project support

   If you're still experiencing upload issues after following the steps above, consider reaching out to the support forums or mailing lists of the relevant BOINC project. The project's support team might be able to offer assistance or guidance in resolving your issue.
