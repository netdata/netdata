<summary>Diagnose a bad driver</summary>

`upsd` expects the drivers to either update their status regularly or at least answer periodic
queries, called pings. If a driver doesnâ€™t answer, `upsd` will declare it "stale" and no more
information will be provided to the clients.

If upsd complains about staleness when you start it, then either your driver or configuration files
are probably broken. Be sure that the driver is actually running, and that the UPS definition in
[ups.conf(5)](https://networkupstools.org/docs/man/ups.conf.html) is correct. Also make sure that
you start your driver(s) before starting upsd.

Data can also be marked stale if the driver can no longer communicate with the UPS. In this case,
the driver should also provide diagnostic information in the syslog. If this happens, check the
serial or USB cabling, or inspect the network path in the case of a SNMP UPS.
