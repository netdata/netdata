### Understand the alert

The `mdstat_last_collected` alert is generated when there is a delay or absence of data collection from the Multiple Device (md) driver for an extended period of time. This can be a sign of an issue with the RAID array or the system itself.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Check the status of the RAID array

   The status of the RAID array can be checked using the following command:

   ```
   cat /proc/mdstat
   ```

   This will display the RAID array's current status, including any errors, degraded state, or rebuilding progress.

2. Ensure the Netdata Agent is running

   Verify that the Netdata Agent is running and collecting data from the system using the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl status netdata
   ```
   
   If the Netdata Agent is not running, start it using:

   ```
   sudo systemctl start netdata
   ```

3. Check if the `mdstat` plugin is enabled in `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf`

   Ensure that the plugin responsible for collecting data from the md driver is enabled. Look for the following lines in `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf`:

   ```
   [plugin:proc:/proc/mdstat]
       dedicated lines for md devices = no (auto)
   ```
   
   Make sure that the option is set as shown above.

4. Check for any hardware issues or faulty disks

   If the RAID array status shows errors or a degraded state, investigate the disks and the RAID controller for any hardware issues or failures. If needed, replace the faulty disk and rebuild the array.

5. Monitor the RAID array and system status

   Keep an eye on the RAID array's status and overall system health. If the issue persists or worsens, consider scheduling downtime for further diagnostics and maintenance.
