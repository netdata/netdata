### Understand the alert

This alert indicates that the status of a virtual drive on your MegaRAID controller is in a degraded state. A degraded state means that the virtual drive's operating condition is not optimal, and one of the configured drives has failed or is offline.

### Troubleshoot the alert

#### General approach

1. Gather more information about your virtual drives in all adapters:

```
root@netdata # megacli â€“LDInfo -Lall -aALL
```

2. Check which virtual drive is in a degraded state and in which adapter.

3. Consult the MegaRAID SAS Software User Guide [1]:

   1. Section `2.1.16` to check what is going wrong with your drives.
   2. Section `7.18` to perform any action on drives. Focus on sections `7.18.2`, `7.18.6`, `7.18.7`, `7.18.8`, `7.18.11`, and `7.18.14`.

### Warning
