### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when a `systemd` mount unit enters a `failed state`. If you receive this alert, it means that your system has encountered an issue with mounting a filesystem or a mount point.

### What is a systemd mount unit?

`systemd` is the init system used in most Linux distributions to manage services, processes, and system startup. A mount unit is a configuration file that describes how a filesystem or mount point should be mounted and managed by `systemd`. 

### What does a failed state mean?

A `failed state` indicates that there was an issue with mounting the filesystem, or the mount point failed to function as expected. This can be caused by multiple factors, such as incorrect configuration, missing dependencies, or hardware issues.

### Troubleshoot the alert

- Identify the failed mount unit

  Check the status of your `systemd` mount units by running:
  ```
  systemctl list-units --type=mount
  ```
  Look for units with a `failed` state.

- Check the journal logs

  To gain more insight into the issue, check the `systemd` journal logs for the failed mount unit:
  ```
  journalctl -u [unit-name]
  ```
  Replace `[unit-name]` with the actual name of the failed mount unit.

- Verify the mount unit configuration

  Review the mount unit configuration file located at `/etc/systemd/system/[unit-name].mount`. Ensure that options such as the filesystem type, device, and mount point are correct.

- Check system logs for hardware or filesystem issues

  Review the system logs (e.g., `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages`) for any hardware or filesystem related errors. Ensure that the device and mount point are properly connected and accessible.

- Restart the mount unit

  If you have made any changes to the configuration or resolved a hardware issue, attempt to restart the mount unit by running:
  ```
  systemctl restart [unit-name].mount
  ```

- Seek technical support

  If the issue persists, consider reaching out to support, as there might be an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.
