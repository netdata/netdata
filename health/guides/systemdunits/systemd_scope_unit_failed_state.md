### Understand the alert

This alert is triggered when a systemd scope unit enters a failed state. If you receive this alert, it means that one of your systemd scope units is not working properly and requires attention.

### What is a systemd scope unit?

Systemd is the system and service manager on modern Linux systems. It is responsible for managing and controlling system processes, services, and units. A scope unit is a type of systemd unit that groups several processes together in a single unit. It is used to organize and manage resources of a group of processes.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Identify the systemd scope unit in the failed state

To list all the systemd scope units on the system, run the following command:

```
systemctl list-units --type=scope
```

Look for the units with a 'failed' state.

2. Check the status of the systemd scope unit

To get more information about the failed systemd scope unit, use the `systemctl status` command followed by the unit name:

```
systemctl status UNIT_NAME
```

This command will display the unit status, any error messages, and the last few lines of the unit logs.

3. Consult the logs for further details

To get additional information about the unit's failure, you can use the `journalctl` command for the specific unit:

```
journalctl -u UNIT_NAME
```

This command will display the logs of the systemd scope unit, allowing you to identify any issues or error messages.

4. Restart the systemd scope unit

If the issue appears to be temporary, try restarting the unit using the following command:

```
systemctl restart UNIT_NAME
```

This will attempt to stop the failed unit and start it again.

5. Debug and fix the issue

If the systemd scope unit keeps failing, refer to the documentation and logs to debug the issue and apply the necessary fixes. You might need to update the unit's configuration, fix application issues, or address system resource limitations.
