### Understand the alert

The `vcsa_system_health` alert indicates the overall health status of your VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA). If you receive this alert, it means that one or more components in the appliance are in a degraded or unhealthy state that could lead to reduced performance or even appliance unresponsiveness.

### Troubleshoot the alert

Perform the following steps to identify and resolve the issue:

1. Log in to the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface (VAMI).

   You can access the VAMI by navigating to `https://<your_vcenter_address>:5480` in a web browser. Log in with the appropriate credentials.

2. Check the System Health status.

   In the VAMI, click on the `Monitor` tab, and then click on `Health`. This will provide you with an overview of the different components and their individual health status.

3. Analyze the affected components.

   Identify the components that are displaying warning (yellow), degraded (orange), or critical (red) health status. These components may be causing the overall `vcsa_system_health` alert.

4. Investigate the problematic components.

   Click on each affected component to find more information about the issue. This may include error messages, suggested actions, and links to relevant documentation.

5. Resolve the issues.

   Follow the recommended actions or consult the VMware documentation to resolve the issues with the affected components.

6. Verify the system health.

   Once the issues have been resolved, refresh the Health page in the VAMI to ensure that all components now display a healthy (green) status. The `vcsa_system_health` alert should clear automatically.
