### Understand the alert

This alert, `web_log_5m_successful_old`, calculates the average number of successful HTTP requests per second for the 5 minutes starting 10 minutes ago. If you receive this alert, it means that there might be a significant change in the number of requests your web server is serving.

### What does the alert mean?

The alert is useful for understanding the workload on your web server based on historical request data. It helps to ensure that the web server is functioning as expected and can handle the current number of users without negatively impacting their experience.

### Troubleshoot the alert

To troubleshoot this alert, follow these steps:

1. **Check the current number of successful HTTP requests** to compare with the historical data of the alert. You can use Netdata's web dashboard to see the current requests rate in real-time. If the number of requests has increased significantly, it might indicate a potential issue.

2. **Identify any potential issues or errors on your web server.** Check the server's error logs for any signs of abnormal behavior or error messages. This can help you determine if there are any underlying issues causing the increase in requests.

3. **Analyze the user traffic** to understand the cause of the increase in successful requests. This could be caused by a sudden spike in website visitors, a DDoS attack, or the introduction of new and popular content on your website. You can use tools like Google Analytics or server access logs to get detailed information about user traffic.

4. **Review server resources and performance** to ensure the web server has adequate resources to handle the request load. If the number of requests is higher than usual, check the server's CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth to ensure optimal performance.

5. **Evaluate server configuration** to check for any misconfigurations, outdated software, or resource limitations that may impact the handling of requests. Update or adjust configurations as necessary to improve the web server's performance.

6. **Monitor and take necessary actions** based on your findings. If the increase in successful requests is a result of legitimate traffic, ensure that your web server can handle the extra load. If the traffic is malicious or the result of an attack, consider implementing security measures like rate-limiting or blocking IPs.
