### Understand the alert

This alert monitors the number of HTTP requests received by your web server in the last minute. If you receive this alert, it means that there is an increase in the workload on your web server.

### What does the number of HTTP requests mean?

HTTP requests are messages sent by clients (like web browsers) to the server to request various resources, such as web pages, images, scripts, and more. An increase in the number of HTTP requests means that there are more clients accessing your web server, which can result in increased resource usage, decreased response times, or potential overloading.

### Troubleshoot the alert

1. Determine if the increase in requests is legitimate or malicious:

   - Review traffic logs to see if the increase in requests is coming from legitimate users or search engine bots, or if it is potentially malicious traffic resulting from bots, crawlers, or DDoS attacks.
 
2. Analyze server logs for anomalies or abnormal request patterns:

   - Look for sudden spikes, repeating requests, or any other suspicious patterns in the server logs. You may use tools like `grep`, `awk`, or web server-specific log analyzers to help with this.
 
3. Check server resources and response times:

   - Monitor your server's CPU, memory, and disk usage to see if the increased requests are causing resource strains or degradations in server performance.
   - Use tools like `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, or monitoring applications for your specific web server software (e.g., `apachetop` for Apache) to help identify the source of the problem.

4. Optimize web server performance:

   - If you find that the increase in requests is legitimate, consider optimizing the web server by enabling caching, improving database query performance, or upgrading hardware and server resources to handle the increased demand.
 
5. Implement security measures:

   - If you have determined that the increase in requests is coming from malicious sources, consider implementing security measures such as rate-limiting, IP blocking, or configuring a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
