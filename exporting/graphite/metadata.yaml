      Use the Graphite connector for the exporting engine to archive your Netdata metrics to Graphite providers for long-term storage,
      further analysis, or correlation with data from other sources.

            detailed_description: |
              The format of each item in this list, is: [PROTOCOL:]IP[:PORT].
              - PROTOCOL can be udp or tcp. tcp is the default and only supported by the current exporting engine.
              - IP can be XX.XX.XX.XX (IPv4), or [XX:XX...XX:XX] (IPv6). For IPv6 you can to enclose the IP in [] to separate it from the port.
              - PORT can be a number of a service name. If omitted, the default port for the exporting connector will be used.

              Example IPv4:
                ```yaml
                destination = 10.11.14.2:2003 10.11.14.3:4242 10.11.14.4:2003
                ```
              Example IPv6 and IPv4 together:
              ```yaml
              destination = [ffff:...:0001]:2003 10.11.12.1:2003
              ```
              When multiple servers are defined, Netdata will try the next one when the previous one fails.

              Netdata will add some randomness to this number, to prevent stressing the external server when many Netdata servers

              Hosts filter. Determines which hosts will be sent to the external database. The syntax is [simple patterns](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/tree/master/libnetdata/simple_pattern#simple-patterns).
            required: false
            detailed_description: |
              Includes one or more space separated patterns, using * as wildcard (any number of times within each pattern).
              The patterns are checked against the hostname (the localhost is always checked as localhost), allowing us to
              filter which hosts will be sent to the external database when this Netdata is a central Netdata aggregating multiple hosts.

              A pattern starting with `!` gives a negative match. So to match all hosts named `*db*` except hosts containing `*child*`,
              use `!*child* *db*` (so, the order is important: the first pattern matching the hostname will be used - positive or negative).
          - name: 'send charts matching'
            default_value: '*'
            description: |
              One or more space separated patterns (use * as wildcard) checked against both chart id and chart name.
            required: false
            detailed_description: |
              A pattern starting with ! gives a negative match. So to match all charts named apps.* except charts ending in *reads,
              use !*reads apps.* (so, the order is important: the first pattern matching the chart id or the chart name will be used,
              positive or negative). There is also a URL parameter filter that can be used while querying allmetrics. The URL parameter
              has a higher priority than the configuration option.

            detailed_description: |
              Netdata supports names and IDs for charts and dimensions. Usually IDs are unique identifiers as read by the system and names
              are human friendly labels (also unique). Most charts and metrics have the same ID and name, but in several cases they are
              different : disks with device-mapper, interrupts, QoS classes, statsd synthetic charts, etc.
