about: General issue template
labels: "needs triage", "no changelog"

<!---
This is a generic issue template. We usually prefer contributors to use one
of 3 other specific issue templates (bug report, feature request, question)
to allow our automation classify those so you can get response faster.
However if your issue doesn't fall into either one of those 3 categories
use this generic template.
