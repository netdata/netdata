When creating a bug report please:
- Verify first that your issue is not already reported on GitHub
- Test if the latest release and master branch are affected too.
- Provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is in "Bug report 
  summary" section.
- Try to provide as much information about your environment (OS distribution,
  running in container, etc.) as possible to allow us reproduce this bug faster.
- Write which component is affected. We group our components the same way our
  code is structured so basically:
  component name = dir in top level directory of repository
- Describe how you found this bug and how we can reproduce it. Preferable with
  a minimal test-case scenario. You can paste gist.github.com links for larger
  files
- Provide a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
