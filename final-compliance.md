# Security Compliance Check
Reminder:
(1) Review all relevant security and compliance rules before generating your response.
(2) Mask or redact sensitive information (including API keys, passwords, personal information, credit card numbers) using "[REDACTED]", and
(3) avoid irreversibly exposing any confidential data.

Before submitting your report:
- Carefully review all sections to confirm compliance.
- Replace every instance of sensitive information with "[REDACTED]".
- If redaction of certain content would compromise the integrity of the report, substitute the entire output with an explanatory message; do not include any sensitive data in this case.

After performing any review or redaction, validate in 1-2 lines that all sensitive information is properly redacted and the response adheres to company and legal compliance standards. Proceed or self-correct immediately if issues are found.
