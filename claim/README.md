# Connect Agent to Cloud

You can securely connect a Netdata Agent, running on a distributed node, to securely connect to Netdata Cloud. A Space's
administrator creates a **claiming token**, which is used to add an Agent to their Space via the [Agent-Cloud link
(ACLK)](/aclk/README.md).

Are you just starting out with Netdata Cloud? See our [get started with
Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/get-started) guide for a walkthrough of the process and simplified
instructions.

Connecting Agents, also referrered as **nodes**, is a security feature in Netdata Cloud. Through the connection process, you demonstrate in a few ways
that you have administrative access to that node and the configuration settings for the Netdata Agent. By logging into the node,
you prove you have access, and by using the claiming script or the Netdata command line, you prove you have write access
and administrative privileges.

Only the administrators of a Space in Netdata Cloud can view the claiming token and accompanying script generated by
Netdata Cloud.

> The connection process ensures no third party can add your node, and then view your node's metrics, in a Cloud account,
> Space, or War Room that you did not authorize.

By connecting a node, you opt-in to sending data from your Agent to Netdata Cloud via the [ACLK](/aclk/README.md). This
data is encrypted by TLS while it is in transit. We use the RSA keypair created during the connection process to authenticate the
identity of the Netdata Agent when it connects to the Cloud. While the data does flow through Netdata Cloud servers on its way
from Agents to the browser, we do not store or log it.

You can connect a node during the Netdata Cloud onboarding process, or after you created a Space by clicking on **Connect
Nodes** in the [Spaces management area](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/spaces#manage-spaces).

There are two important notes regarding connecting nodes:

-   _You can only connect any given node in a single Space_. You can, however, add that connected node to multiple War Rooms
    within that one Space.
-   You must repeat the connection process on every node you want to add to Netdata Cloud.

## How to connect a node

To connect a node, select which War Rooms you want to add this node to with the dropdown, then copy and paste the script
given by Cloud into your node's terminal. Hit **Enter**.

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if you don't see
the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting). If you prefer not to
use root privileges via `sudo` to run the claiming script, see the next section.

Repeat this process with every node you want to add to Cloud during onboarding. You can also add more nodes once you've
finished onboarding.

### Connect an agent without root privileges

If you don't want to run the claiming script with root privileges, you can discover which user is running the Agent,
switch to that user, and run the claiming script.

Use `grep` to search your `netdata.conf` file, which is typically located at `/etc/netdata/netdata.conf`, for the `run
as user` setting. For example:

```bash
grep "run as user" /etc/netdata/netdata.conf 
    # run as user = netdata
```

The default user is `netdata`. Yours may be different, so pay attention to the output from `grep`. Switch to that user
and run the claiming script.

```bash
netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting). 

### Connect an Agent running in Docker

To connect an instance of the Netdata Agent running inside of a Docker container, either set claiming environment
variables in the container to have it automatically connected on startup or restart, or use `docker exec` to manually
connect an already running container.

For the connection process to work, the contents of `/var/lib/netdata` _must_ be preserved across container
restarts using a persistent volume.  See our [recommended `docker run` and Docker Compose
examples](/packaging/docker/README.md#create-a-new-netdata-agent-container) for details.

#### Using environment variables

The Netdata Docker container looks for the following environment variables on startup:

- `NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN`
- `NETDATA_CLAIM_URL`
- `NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOMS`
- `NETDATA_CLAIM_PROXY`

If the token and URL are specified in their corresponding variables _and_ the container is not already connected,
it will use these values to attempt to connect the container, automatically adding the node to the specified War
Rooms. If a proxy is specified, it will be used for the connection process and for connecting to Netdata Cloud.

These variables can be specified using any mechanism supported by your container tooling for setting environment
variables inside containers. For example, when creating a new Netdata continer using `docker run`, the following
modified version of the command can be used to set the variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name=netdata \
  -p 19999:19999 \
  -v netdatalib:/var/lib/netdata \
  -v netdatacache:/var/cache/netdata \
  -v /etc/passwd:/host/etc/passwd:ro \
  -v /etc/group:/host/etc/group:ro \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /etc/os-release:/host/etc/os-release:ro \
  -e NETDATA_CLAIM_TOKEN=TOKEN \
  -e NETDATA_CLAIM_URL="https://app.netdata.cloud" \
  -e NETDATA_CLAIM_ROOMS=ROOM1,ROOM2 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_PTRACE \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  netdata/netdata
```

Output that would be seen from the claiming script when using other methods will be present in the container logs.

Using the environment variables like this to handle the connection process is the preferred method of connecting Docker containers
as it works in the widest variety of situations and simplifies configuration management.

#### Using docker exec

Connect a _running Netdata Agent container_ by appending the script offered by Cloud to a `docker exec ...` command, replacing
`netdata` with the name of your running container:

```bash
docker exec -it netdata netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud
```

The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting).

### Connect a Kubernetes cluster's parent Netdata pod

Read our [Kubernetes installation](/packaging/installer/methods/kubernetes.md#connect-a-kubernetes-clusters-parent-pod)
for details on connecting a parent Netdata pod.

### Connect through a proxy

A Space's administrator can connect a node through a SOCKS5 or HTTP(S) proxy.

You should first configure the proxy in the `[cloud]` section of `netdata.conf`. The proxy settings you specify here
will also be used to tunnel the ACLK. The default `proxy` setting is `none`.

```conf
[cloud]
    proxy = none
```

The `proxy` setting can take one of the following values:

-   `none`: Do not use a proxy, even if the system configured otherwise.
-   `env`: Try to read proxy settings from set environment variables `http_proxy`/`socks_proxy`.
-   `socks5[h]://[user:pass@]host:ip`: The ACLK and connection process will use the specified SOCKS5 proxy.
-   `http://[user:pass@]host:ip`: The ACLK and connection process will use the specified HTTP(S) proxy.

For example, a SOCKS5 proxy setting may look like the following:

```conf
[cloud]
    proxy = socks5h://203.0.113.0:1080       # With an IP address
    proxy = socks5h://proxy.example.com:1080 # With a URL
```

You can now move on to connecting. When you connect with the `netdata-claim.sh` script, add the `-proxy=` parameter and
append the same proxy setting you added to `netdata.conf`.

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud -proxy=socks5h://203.0.113.0:1080
```

Hit **Enter**. The script should return `Agent was successfully claimed.`. If the claiming script returns errors, or if
you don't see the node in your Space after 60 seconds, see the [troubleshooting information](#troubleshooting).

### Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble connecting a node, this may be because the [ACLK](/aclk/README.md) cannot connect to Cloud.

With the Netdata Agent running, visit `http://NODE:19999/api/v1/info` in your browser, replacing `NODE` with the IP
address or hostname of your Agent. The returned JSON contains four keys that will be helpful to diagnose any issues you
might be having with the ACLK or connection process.

```json
	"cloud-enabled"
	"cloud-available"
	"agent-claimed"
	"aclk-available"
```

Use these keys and the information below to troubleshoot the ACLK.

#### bash: netdata-claim.sh: command not found

If you run the claiming script and see a `command not found` error, you either installed Netdata in a non-standard
location or are using an unsupported package. If you installed Netdata in a non-standard path using the `--install`
option, you need to update your `$PATH` or run `netdata-claim.sh` using the full path. For example, if you installed
Netdata to `/opt/netdata`, use `/opt/netdata/bin/netdata-claim.sh` to run the claiming script.

If you are using an unsupported package, such as a third-party `.deb`/`.rpm` package provided by your distribution,
please remove that package and reinstall using our [recommended kickstart
script](/docs/get-started.mdx#install-on-linux-with-one-line-installer-recommended).

#### Connecting on older distributions (Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 8, CentOS 6)

If you're running an older Linux distribution or one that has reached EOL, such as Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian 8, or CentOS
6, your Agent may not be able to securely connect to Netdata Cloud due to an outdated version of OpenSSL. These old
versions of OpenSSL cannot perform [hostname validation](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Hostname_validation), which
helps securely encrypt SSL connections.

We recommend you reinstall Netdata with a [static build](/packaging/installer/methods/kickstart-64.md), which uses an
up-to-date version of OpenSSL with hostname validation enabled.

If you choose to continue using the outdated version of OpenSSL, your node will still connect to Netdata Cloud, albeit
with hostname verification disabled. Without verification, your Netdata Cloud connection could be vulnerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### cloud-enabled is false

If `cloud-enabled` is `false`, you probably ran the installer with `--disable-cloud` option.

Additionally, check that the `enabled` setting in `var/lib/netdata/cloud.d/cloud.conf` is set to `true`:

```conf
[global]
    enabled = true
```

To fix this issue, reinstall Netdata using your [preferred method](/packaging/installer/README.md) and do not add the
`--disable-cloud` option.

#### cloud-available is false

If `cloud-available` is `false` after you verified Cloud is enabled in the previous step, the most likely issue is that
Cloud features failed to build during installation.

If Cloud features fail to build, the installer continues and finishes the process without Cloud functionality as opposed
to failing the installation altogether. We do this to ensure the Agent will always finish installing.

If you can't see an explicit error in the installer's output, you can run the installer with the `--require-cloud`
option. This option causes the installation to fail if Cloud functionality can't be built and enabled, and the
installer's output should give you more error details.

You may see one of the following error messages during installation:

-   Failed to build libmosquitto. The install process will continue, but you will not be able to connect this node to
    Netdata Cloud.
-   Unable to fetch sources for libmosquitto. The install process will continue, but you will not be able to connect
    this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Failed to build libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not be able to connect this node to
    Netdata Cloud.
-   Unable to fetch sources for libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not be able to connect
    this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Could not find cmake, which is required to build libwebsockets. The install process will continue, but you may not
    be able to connect this node to Netdata Cloud.
-   Could not find cmake, which is required to build JSON-C. The install process will continue, but Netdata Cloud
    support will be disabled.
-   Failed to build JSON-C. Netdata Cloud support will be disabled.
-   Unable to fetch sources for JSON-C. Netdata Cloud support will be disabled.

One common cause of the installer failing to build Cloud features is not having one of the following dependencies on
your system: `cmake` and OpenSSL, including the `devel` package.

You can also look for error messages in `/var/log/netdata/error.log`. Try one of the following two commands to search
for ACLK-related errors.

```bash
less /var/log/netdata/error.log
grep -i ACLK /var/log/netdata/error.log
```

If the installer's output does not help you enable Cloud features, contact us by [creating an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+needs+triage%2C+ACLK&template=bug_report.md&title=The+installer+failed+to+prepare+the+required+dependencies+for+Netdata+Cloud+functionality)
with details about your system and relevant output from `error.log`.

#### agent-claimed is false

You must [connect your node](#how-to-connect-a-node).

#### aclk-available is false

If `aclk-available` is `false` and all other keys are `true`, your Agent is having trouble connecting to the Cloud
through the ACLK. Please check your system's firewall.

If your Agent needs to use a proxy to access the internet, you must [set up a proxy for
connecting](#connect-through-a-proxy).

If you are certain firewall and proxy settings are not the issue, you should consult the Agent's `error.log` at
`/var/log/netdata/error.log` and contact us by [creating an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/new?labels=bug%2C+needs+triage%2C+ACLK&template=bug_report.md&title=ACLK-available-is-false)
with details about your system and relevant output from `error.log`.

### Remove and reconnect a node

To remove a node from your Space in Netdata Cloud, delete the `cloud.d/` directory in your Netdata library directory.

```bash
cd /var/lib/netdata   # Replace with your Netdata library directory, if not /var/lib/netdata/
sudo rm -rf cloud.d/
```

This node no longer has access to the credentials it was used when connecting to Netdata Cloud via the ACLK.
You will still be able to see this node in your War Rooms in an **unreachable** state.

If you want to reconnect this node into a different Space, you need to create a new identity by adding `-id=$(uuidgen)` to
the claiming script parameters. Make sure that you have the `uuidgen-runtime` package installed, as it is used to run the command `uuidgen`. For example, using the default claiming script:

```bash
sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=https://app.netdata.cloud -id=$(uuidgen)
```

The agent _must be restarted_ after this change.

## Connecting reference

In the sections below, you can find reference material for the claiming script, connecting via the Agent's command line
tool, and details about the files found in `cloud.d`.

### The `cloud.conf` file

This section defines how and whether your Agent connects to [Netdata Cloud](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/)
using the [ACLK](/aclk/README.md).

| setting        | default                   | info                                                                                                                                   |
|:-------------- |:------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cloud base url | https://app.netdata.cloud | The URL for the Netdata Cloud web application. You should not change this. If you want to disable Cloud, change the `enabled` setting. |
| enabled        | yes                       | The runtime option to disable the [Agent-Cloud link](/aclk/README.md) and prevent your Agent from connecting to Netdata Cloud.         |

### Claiming script

A Space's administrator can connect an Agent by directly calling the `netdata-claim.sh` script either with root privileges
using `sudo`, or as the user running the Agent (typically `netdata`), and passing the following arguments:

```sh
-token=TOKEN
    where TOKEN is the Space's claiming token.
-rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2,...
    where ROOMX is the War Room this node should be added to. This list is optional.
-url=URL_BASE
    where URL_BASE is the Netdata Cloud endpoint base URL. By default, this is https://app.netdata.cloud.
-id=AGENT_ID
    where AGENT_ID is the unique identifier of the Agent. This is the Agent's MACHINE_GUID by default.
-hostname=HOSTNAME
    where HOSTNAME is the result of the hostname command by default.
-proxy=PROXY_URL
    where PROXY_URL is the endpoint of a SOCKS5 proxy.
```

For example, the following command connects an Agent and adds it to rooms `room1` and `room2`:

```sh
netdata-claim.sh -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2
```

You should then update the `netdata` service about the result with `netdatacli`:

```sh
netdatacli reload-claiming-state
```

This reloads the Agent connection state from disk.

### Netdata Agent command line

If a Netdata Agent is running, the Space's administrator can connect a node using the `netdata` service binary with
additional command line parameters:

```sh
-W "claim -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2"
```

For example:

```sh
/usr/sbin/netdata -D -W "claim -token=MYTOKEN1234567 -rooms=room1,room2"
```

If need be, the user can override the Agent's defaults by providing additional arguments like those described
[here](#claiming-script).

### Connection directory

Netdata stores the Agent's connection-related state in the Netdata library directory under `cloud.d`. For a default
installation, this directory exists at `/var/lib/netdata/cloud.d`. The directory and its files should be owned by the
user that runs the Agent, which is typically the `netdata` user.

The `cloud.d/token` file should contain the claiming-token and the `cloud.d/rooms` file should contain the list of War
Rooms you added that node to.

The user can also put the Cloud endpoint's full certificate chain in `cloud.d/cloud_fullchain.pem` so that the Agent
can trust the endpoint if necessary.
